App is only designed for phone in portrait mode. Worthless on tablet. News is oriented for people who like to scroll & scroll with pictures. Direct viewing of headlines is gone. Limited push of notifications & notifications do not take you to story but rather to the home page. Gone is night mode. TV is accessible but slow to load & not always obvious or located in same spot. TV in landscape is is worthless as a big pause & share icon take real estate along with a close X. Appear to have corrected graying out of TV in landscape.

What was blooming Bloomberg thinking? Oh  sorry I missed the point  you weren't thinking! They actually pay (overpay  by a lot judging by the results) someone to flop  like a dead Bloombird falling to earth!

I have to keep changing news categories on another screen wheras before it was all one one screen. Not happy that I was forced to upgrade! I really don't like the bright white background. Bring back the dark theme as an option and I'll consider coming back. Until then uninstalling.,January 30 2017,1
465662,645779,a92dc5ab-e89c-11e6-ba6b-fa163e345ce9,com.bloomberg.android.plus,New update is horrible. At least with old app you had a summary of stocks and news on one page.

465664,645782,aaa5beb2-e89c-11e6-ba6b-fa163e345ce9,com.bloomberg.android.plus,A very different look from the previous version  but lacks the simple amalgamation of market info and news. This new version has lost some of the previous customizing functions and you now need to move from screen to screen to see what used to be available on one screen.

A major retrograde step in my opinion. The old app was so easy to use and 'intuitive'; you knew where everything was  the split screen on my tablet was great. I could go on. This app is now cr*p. It's the old adage  if it 'aint broke don't fix it. I beggars belief how Bloomberg developers see this as an improvement on the old version. Listen to your users you muppets !!,January 30 2017,1

It is simply unusable; the app crashes within 5 seconds of opening it every time and on reopening may last to clicking on an article before it crashes again. On the rare occasion it opens an article  switching to another app and back again forces the app to reload to the homepage - utterly useless. I've given the developers a long time since the revamp of the app to iron out these bugs but in the 3 or 4 months since there has been no change  despite me sending numerous diagnostic reports.
