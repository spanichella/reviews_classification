There is one issue: I have a phone where most of the time I use the fingerprint to unlock. Because this needs system administrator privelages  often I will click and my phone will tell me that because of Android security policy I need to enter my pin  and not use fingerprint. Also  it would be simpler if you could set a fingerprint within the lock screen instead of having to clock again to your normal lock screen to unlock.,October 02 2016,3

30449,32811,7c554cc7-afc9-11e6-bc36-c4b301cdf627,com.achep.acdisplay,1. WHEN USING LOCK SCREEN FUNCTION WITH PASSWORD CAMERA WILL NOT OPEN. If you want to use the AcDisplay lock screen and a pin  you simply enable AcDisplay on top of your stock lock screen. However  when opening camera from an off display using volume button shortcuts  AcDisplay will be in your way. Also  when using the AcDisplay camera shortcut  you will have to enter your pin before being able to use the camera (versus being able to use camera from the lock screen with the stock lock screen). 2. PHONES WITH FINGER SCANNERS MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY. Many phones such as the Honor 5x  Honor 8  Nexus 5x  and Nexus 6p have a fingerprint scanner that allows you to go from an off display directly to the home screen when your finger is scanned. You cannot do this with AcDisplay  as the AcDisplay lock screen will open up every time your phone is unlocked.,September 23 2016,3

30484,32846,7c55617a-afc9-11e6-b811-c4b301cdf627,com.achep.acdisplay,Works as expexted  but doesnt solve Android issue This is a great small and free app  but it doesn't solve underlying problem with Android Lollipop 5.0.2 screen lock. I've searched for some app to show small and compact notifications after upgrade from Kitkat 4.4.4 to Lollipop 5.0.2 on my Sony Xperia Z3 compact. Despite this beauty works smooth  it only makes things worse: to unlock a mobile I need to make FOUR actions: press power button  swipe AcDisplay screen  swipe my unlock pattern.

In fact  it notes the lockscreen feature is still in beta testing so really this app is not doing its 1 job. Example: phone unlocks automatically without swiping and can be done by just a button. Sometimes even auto unlocks when a notification comes up. For the most part this app looks promising as it's clean and minimal.

Also  custom apps/shortcut/actions for the corner gestures would be very useful too.

31305,33704,7c5725fa-afc9-11e6-bec8-c4b301cdf627,com.achep.acdisplay,Love it. But please add a feature of locking device by pattern or pin. Because once we get notification   we have to unlock acdisplay and then phone pattern. This is quite annoying. So it'd be better if you guys provide pattern or pin lock. Awesome work at last.,March 11 2016,4
31306,33705,7c57267a-afc9-11e6-a6fb-c4b301cdf627,com.achep.acdisplay,Worked just fine for a long time until now and made me almost buy a new phone I used this app for a long time on my Asus Zenfone 5. About 1 month ago  mostly right after unlocking the screen and sometimes randomly  the display tilts/shifts with an absurd angle and goes grayscale and then shortly after phone freezes  makes me do a hard reset. I thought it was a phone problem because I hadn't installed a new app. But then I thought maybe it's about this app  because it happened mostly after unlocking. So i disabled it and the problem solved. Hope this gets fixed. Cheers,March 11 2016,3

I'd gladly give 5 stars as I'm sure a lot of hard work goes into this app  but functionality seems diminished by my finger print security requirements.

31628,34041,7c57d638-afc9-11e6-b5bf-c4b301cdf627,com.achep.acdisplay,Little bug When i was unlocking my phone  sometimes it has delay and after 1 to 2 seconds the lockscreen will appear. And when someones calling  i need to unlock 1st before i can see whos calling. Its nice and clean but need passcode. I'll give 5 star for this lockscreen because in my opinion this is the best.

You can't set custom shortcuts for unlock areas that aren't just dialer/camera (what about SMS? or a custom activity?). It doesn't seem to block the home button if you have your system lock screen disabled. If you *don't* disable your system lock screen  it takes about 5 seconds for AC display to appear when you wake up your phone. It doesn't report widget size to widgets  so many can't work properly.,December 03 2015,2

I just wish there was the ability to leave the screen on longer (until I dismiss  1 hour  etc)  maybe contact photos for notifications  proximity sensors  and shortcuts on lock screen.

32145,34583,7c58ed99-afc9-11e6-b628-c4b301cdf627,com.achep.acdisplay,On LGG4 w/Lollipop 5.1. It has a lot of potential. Like others  I've found several bugs that compromise security. I am sure developer will update soon. One recommendation: it would be great if the lockscreen option would actually lock phone after a set lock timer  then a numerical code  pattern code or tap code (LG G4) could be used to unlock after swiping the AcDisplay screen. For periods of time under the lock timer  the screen would simply timeout and as usual and user would be able to wake the phone by swiping on the AcDisplay screen.,October 19 2015,4

I will get a message when I unlock my phone with the fingerprint scanner (Nexus 6p) that a device administrator (AcDisplay) has locked the phone and I then need to put my pattern in. You have the grant AcDisplay device admin permissions so there is no way around this for now. If it ever gets updated  I'll try again. So close!,December 06 2016,3

32457,34924,788215bd-ffa0-11e6-be13-000c29dba5da,com.achep.acdisplay,If your looking for a lockscreen this app is incomplete. In fact  it notes the lockscreen feature is still in beta testing so really this app is not doing its 1 job. Example: phone unlocks automatically without swiping and can be done by just a button. Sometimes even auto unlocks when a notification comes up. For the most part this app looks promising as it's clean and minimal. However it's like a video-game you buy which needs constant DLC to make it work.,March 01 2017,1

32635,35121,5d77270a-447d-11e7-b318-000c29dba5da,com.achep.acdisplay,Hi   I'm a Nexus 5x user   and I'm using your app right now   the app requires device administrator permissions right ?   The problem is when I use fingerprint unlock   the device keeps locked and then when I swipe it   it shows that The device administrator locked device   I had to put on my pin code Everytime that makes my fingerprint feature unusable   please fix this. Sometimes fingerprint feature works but mostly it doesn't . Please fix . I'll be waiting for response and update .,May 24 2017,3
