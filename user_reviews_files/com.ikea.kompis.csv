Only allows one shopping list  when using swipe typing it doesn't automatically add spaces  confusing item stock availability (discontinued item!? Which one?!  doesn't show stock counts). I also liked in the old version that you could look products up by type...

I liked to be able to do that to compare products/prices.,September 15 2015,1

333799,454837,a823e002-1428-11e7-8f31-000c29dba5da,com.ikea.kompis,Whoever designed this for Ikea needs to be fired. It was bad enough that Ikea's old app now only tells you that there's a new app and then exits  blocking you from accessing your account details (like your 19 digit Ikea Family number)  but this new app doesn't even import your data from the old app. What were they thinking? That people memorize a 19 digit membership number and can enter it on demand? They have also gone from a clear  intuitive  easy to use app  to this junk where nothing is easy to find. There's also a glaring security flaw here in that the app automatically makes you log in fresh each time  but will display your Ikea Family card without logging in. My advice is to avoid this garbage app and just go online or to a store.,March 26 2017,1

Bad sync with your purchase list (I got someone else's list and can't see my own I made on my PC) and the app has big problems with passwords. I can only login using temporary passwords for some reason. The only good thing about the app is that it displays shelf numbers for your warehouse (in your purchase list).

Still unusable for me  because of broken syncing.,May 24 2017,2
