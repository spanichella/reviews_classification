I started out using the free version but saw the need for the upgrade pretty quickly. It's hard to fairly rate this app just going off the free version. The difference with the premium package (4.99) is like night and day and 100% worth it if you stream frequently. Ad blocker  desktop mode  etc. change the experience completely. C'mon people  skip Starbucks for a day and spend the 4.99 on the upgrade. The developers need it to keep improving. Great app!,January 07 2017,5

I'm grateful we finally have an update  but they should be continuous & at least when our Samsung SmartTV's are automatically updated.
