The least I could expect is too be locked out. At least refund my money or let me have a verification code through my email or give us a couple of minutes then send the code again My version is latest. I have been on Tinder for a month. I did delete and installed it back again  but still I am getting error message. Make it easy for your customers to enjoy your services. Most of the complaint here is verification code. Fix it. Yahoo was once the popular email and search engine. Google is currently the best because of the same reasons.

But I have to say that it is only an app and it's not a magic imbued shag catcher - it is ultimately up to how decent looking you are and you avoid words like 'marriage  serious relationship  already have nine kids to eleven different fathers.' Oh and ladies  recent photos and stop with the crap awful filters that make you look like a Japanese sex robot; they are so obvious and only says you are fibbing!,January 12 2017,5

Tinder has gone from somewhat ok to utter crap in the past year - changes to your profile either don't take effect at all or happen at random. Updating your work or school information is the most cumbersome process I've ever seen  pictures change at random and updating/swapping them is simply broken. It seems to have more paid features than ever but the quality is worse and worse. App shows more and wrong personal info to people and is simply broken!!!,January 12 2017,1

""""""""""""""""Smart Photos"""""""""""""""" feature seems to change the picked picture as it should when enabled  so this implies that said picture has been getting right swiped  yet after 2 months only got VERY limited matches. So either it deliberately avoids showing you people who have right swiped (defeating the point of the app) unless you pay  or the smart photos feature is bollocks  or it only works as you expect if you pay  either way its a bad sign.""""",January 12 2017,1

338396,460226,464cabf7-e128-11e6-8fa8-fa163e345ce9,com.tinder,Not only is the app a broken  unstable mess  but I would estimate that realistically  about 90% of profiles are spambots. This is not an exaggeration. It is mind-blowing to me how there is seemingly no effective preventative measure in place to at least help REDUCE the number of fakes. Instead  you have to wade through 20 clearly  obviously  not-even-trying-to-hide-it spam profiles before finding a single real one. Repeat ad nauseum. Even something as simple as messaging is bad. After a page's worth of a conversation with someone  the app started forcing the screen to bounce back up to the top after every new message. It's hard to explain in words alone how annoying that was. Thankfully it would crash every five or so messages anyway  so that I could get a break from its unbearable bugginess. Oh  wait.,January 22 2017,1

For the ones that are there  most are fake or dead profiles (user no longer uses account). Overall  1 in every 500 profile belongs to a genuine girl. So  this service of Tinder becomes practically useless. But  I have given 2 stars because other services are even much worse. And the Tinder app itself is pretty nice.

Makes you beg to keep seeing potential new matches  which is lame: only shows you a few new people per day and you have to come back every few hours or so to see one more person even though I live in a large city and have a large search radius . After swiping a few people  swiping left or right no longer works and you have to use the buttons  and those also stop working after a few presses.,January 27 2017,1

From meeting my favorite person in Washington state  going on a 400 mile date on the I-90 with a beautiful man who has a wonderfully adventourous soul  to meeting a traveling hippie my first week in Virginia.

App closes all the time and logs out of your FB page constantly.even reinstalling doesn't help.after you fight to get to the site itself you are faced with the raw unpleasantness that is Tinder. The app developers must not care about there users because about one in three profiles are bots  and that's not a joke. spaming the whole user interface and sending you links to sketch AF website DON'T CLICK ON THEM YOU MORONS!! ie: Michelle is student from student  Casey attends Michigan State  Lydia is New York from New York. Basically if they aren't from your local area you just know  and anything from New York is just terrible news! These are so proliferous I can only assume Tinder is making money off of it  which makes this no better than a porn site and is sad. There are really three types of people on here when you get down to it. 1st: 2/3 girls who have in there bio """"""""""""""""not here for sex"""""""""""""""" which is like when you got to a bar (lol like you've ever been out  if you're reading this and considering getting Tinder you probably have no social life  which is cool neither do I anymore) to meet girls hopefully trying for a one night stand but deep down you're holding out for something real and potentially meaningful  and then you meet these girls who are prude AF and shut you down before you even open your mouth  yeah that's Tinder for you  right there. PS: most of these girls are not even that attractive they just want to crush a man so they can feel like they are seriously all the hot chicks migrated somewhere else  called real life! 2nd:1/3 semi attractive women who only use Tinder to grow there social media following  which let's be honest is pretty smart... I you don't want a bunch of horny guys posting sh!t you don't want have public all the time  then maybe reconsider that option and grow it organically 3rd: 0.001% users  are like me who are normal people not like the rest of these weirdos (seriously weird people on here check out reddit pages of this stuff it's hilarious) who admit they don't have time for a social life but wouldn't mind getting dinner sometime  watching some Netflix on the weekend  but since that is literally to much to ask for we are relegated to what ever this mess of an application is. Sorry if you work hard and were looking for an easy way to meet cute real people that's too hard for the internet to provide...Snif (single tear) PS: bumble is the worst idea ever conceived  girls will never have the balls to message first and if they did you are into some weird stuff and shouldn't be surprised by what you find.""""",January 30 2017,1

Dates were listed on a person's last use (to spare wasting your effort on long time inactive users)  and as a male  I would receive quite exciting numbers of matches each day with an unpaid account. My routine was to have a new date every week  and it was exciting. A relationship formed (which no longer is) which resulted in me uninstalling  and during that time a new algorithm was introduced. Since the introduction of the boost function and the new elo rating algorithm  I've seen a tenfold drop in daily matches. I was concerned it was just me  but ask any non paying male member and you'll hear the same thing. Tinder is essentially creating insecurity in """"""""""""""""veteran"""""""""""""""" users and exploiting that fear by showing the solutions that can be remedied by boosts and plus accounts ($$$). Watch a person buy a boost for the first time. The matches will rain heavily. The new tinder algorithm is money hungry. Try other apps.""""",January 30 2017,1

340173,462411,c5fd5f32-ec3f-11e6-a3aa-fa163e345ce9,com.tinder,The concept of the app is great  but the user interface can be drastically improved. First  it's too easy to accidentally hit the boost button. If you have tinder plus  accidentally wasting your weekly boost at 10am kinda sucks. Second  it's the same swiping motion that rejects a profile (swipe left) that scrolls through the pictures  the only difference being a tap on the profile first. More than a few times the app has jumped back to the reject/accept swipe  causing my intended picture scroll to reject people. If they could fix these issues  the app would be much better.,February 05 2017,3

I haven't gone on a tinder date yet since its my first day but i thought I'd share my option on the app its self. Its great and makes me feel safe to choose & even have the nerve to go out with one of these people (: like if you put that you like them they dont know until they press the like button on you as well.

341626,464263,b6b39f13-f335-11e6-885c-000c29dba5da,com.tinder,So Tinder isn't a bad app but it is kinda hit or miss. On frequent occasions I've met a cool person and have had a really great conversation only to have the person go dark. Because you're kind of competing with every other person on the site sometimes ghosting happens all too frequently. I have had success but its sort of like finding a diamond in a coal mine. The successes are few and far between simply because of some glitches in the app. Otherwise tinder is not a bad app if you're looking to meet someone,February 11 2017,3

341637,464282,c05d6077-f335-11e6-885c-000c29dba5da,com.tinder,I honestly do like it  but the main problem is the responsiveness (or lack thereof) that most guys and some girls get  even though a match was made. If there could be some sort of rating system where people could record the responsiveness of the people they're talking to  and from there calculate a percentage of responses that the person gives  and then either display it on their bio or make them less likely to show up on your feed. That way you're not just wasting likes on people that match with you  but never respond. It's no secret that a lot of people just get tinder to see how many matches they can get for their own ego  but have no intention of being social  so to promote your goal of maintaining a social app  I believe that it would be beneficial to everyone if you were to implement this.,February 11 2017,4

341780,464466,ff2a45b3-f337-11e6-885c-000c29dba5da,com.tinder,I bought premium for a month to give it a try. Unlimited likes are fine  more super likes is meh  I haven't try boost yet. I recommend premium if you live on big cities  in Athens  GR there is not much of success at least for me. The downside of premium  I was getting drip feed (when you get none is around you thing). Athens is a big bed. It's impossible to be only around 200 tinder users. Conclusion  no matter how good person you may be in real life. On dating apps is your looks is what brings you success. Get some clear photos outside your house doing activities or whatever. Write some short bio and good luck.,February 10 2017,3

341895,464622,428bceb7-f33a-11e6-885c-000c29dba5da,com.tinder,The sheer number of fake users makes the app effectively unusable. In any major metropolitan area  I'd estimate 80% of users are fake  and you can tell simply by the similarities shared by all the scammers. Tinder clearly has no interest in policing this  as it's only gotten worse over time. Presumably they don't police this because it makes it look (to rubes) like there's tons of super attractive users. Bumble does not have this problem AT ALL so clearly it is solvable. Tinder just doesn't care. Useless app in its present state.,February 09 2017,1

What it really bothers me is that you can't known when people are online  it doesn't give you the option to it.

341906,464637,4aa79d06-f33a-11e6-885c-000c29dba5da,com.tinder,At one time Tinder was an excellent app. A person could get many matches and it was a genuinely great advancement to the world of online dating. Then the developers decided to make some money due to popularity  which is fine. The problems with this lies with the fact that they got greedy by limiting the amount of right swipes you're now allowed  which is a pathetic number. The monthly pricing is completely out to lunch. I am recommending that people instead download the Bumble app  you get unlimited matches with a platform that rarely glitches out  unlike Tinder. The folks at Tinder should be ashamed for becoming greedy  it's a slap in the face to the early users who made the app as popular as it is.,February 09 2017,2

Another problem that tinder has always had was the people search. It will say there no more people in your area when there are. For example. Yesterday I saw a girl I wanted to swipe right on. I had no likes. I waited till the next day. Swiped a few times until it said  """"no more people in my area"""". Yet I never even re-encountered that girl. This happens ALOT so ik its not the slight chance they deleted there account. I noticed if it says no more people. And if i increase my distance from 50 to 100. Let it load. Then revert it back. More users magically pop up within 50 miles. So something is up. And i find it odd that it still hasn't been fixed.",February 15 2017,2

Well I've read all of them  just haven't replied to any and after recent log out and log in they appear as unread. Would be nice to display unread messages only instead of searching for them one by one so I can reply to them. How come you've never added a simple scrollbar? Going through the matches is a pain! Edit: Two months after I've left my comment  lots of updates but nothing much really changed. Oh  wait... I've lost 100 matches and old ones are reappearing as new ones. Plus I'm keep on seeing same girl every day for over a week even after swiping in her. Also  I just wanted to read one profile but after tapping on it  I have a Super Like instead.

Used to be one free boost a week then suddenly it's a free boost per month. Clearly too many people in here so they should have multiple servers or lobbies to choose from divided by either location or intention. Also need to have a post match filter system so you can filter your matches by name age and location. I remember a few years ago this app was outstanding. Now it's clearly about the money.,February 19 2017,5

You find some awesome people really close by that you may never have met otherwise.

And all of today i havnt been able to use the app at all.

Another thing is even if you pay they only let you see a small percentage of who's in your area on an attempt to make you use the app longer. I wish paying prevented their bottlenecking.

I also don't like this newer system where you only see the people who get similar swipes as you... tbh they're usually butt ugly. Can't we try a new thing where we get to choose a type?

There is however one small thing you could add. Somehow have a section in the settings where you could block a certain location/school. For example  New York University!!!!!! They are full a fake profiles and they usually have a blurry picture. It's really annoying have to swipe left 200 times just because there's so many fake profiles. Also  for some positive feedback  if you could have a selection of a University so a person would be able to narrow down their searches. Other than all that. I love the app!,February 17 2017,5

""""badoo"""" have a number of verification methods to weed out the fake profiles. You can see how many friends they have on Facebook  link Facebook photos  request a real time selfie  send photos through messaging and a start up verification photo. Any profiles that don't have this  you can pretty much guarentee they're fake. Perhaps tinder doesn't want to alert you to the fake profiles because without them  there wouldn't be much to swipe through. Who knows  but there are so many people complaining and not much being done about it  so it leads me to believe tinder are using the """"padding"""" to their advantage.

This is not a temporary issue as Tinders nonexistent support claims here. I had installed and reinstalled at least half a dozen times... Still can't login. I guess this is the best tender can do.

Also  would like it if they didn't limit the amount of people we like/dislike. Would also like to have a way to search for spacific people.

Absolutely nothing. Plus on top of all these issues the support is awful. They tell you the same thing every time. This app is nothing but a waste of time.

It duplicates photos for some reason  and at times its very slow and unresponsive! I find im swiping the same people sometimes 5 times in the space of a week.

344513,467936,fd28cef9-fe1f-11e6-b347-000c29dba5da,com.tinder,2nd review: Really getting sick of the bots now. The most recent update has seen a sudden influx of bots. I live in New Zealand and 4/5 females I come across are said to be studying working living in America except their location is that of 5-20kms from me. What's going on?!! I either use up all my swipes or waste my time sifting through irrelevant potential matches. Sort it out!,February 27 2017,1
344514,467937,fe4c194a-fe1f-11e6-b347-000c29dba5da,com.tinder,The app is just awful it has so many problems I have to uninstall it and RE install it almost every time I want to access it which is ridiculous.the messaging part is just rubbish you can't reply and read their message at the same time as it takes you back to the first message when writing and if you try to bring theirs back up just to remind you what they said you have to start writing yours all over again the distance part does not work I matched with someone less than 20 miles away who turned out to be in America I was in the UK  it does this generally all the time honestly the idea behind it is great but it is plagued with problems that don't ever seem to be corrected.,February 27 2017,1

344537,467963,c4bff47b-ffb0-11e6-be13-000c29dba5da,com.tinder,90% of females matches on here are bots asking to chat via some dodgy link  however I'm giving it two stars because I have met a few real people on here and the bots are getting easier to identify  they all seem to be 8km away  have a different name to what's in their profile and most have studied at an overseas school and work for ridiculous companies  they also like to use photos of famous celebrities  this week I matched with Nicole Kidman and the boring chick from Twilight...you know the one that never smiles. And the chat system on this app sucks  almost impossible to scroll up and read previous messages sent. And whats with guys only getting one free super like a day when girls get 5 free super likes?

Meaning  they think they are good enough to date Brad Pitt. (which they are not  not even close) You need to have very good photos.

344754,468249,67287ea9-ffb1-11e6-be13-000c29dba5da,com.tinder,It's alright but is plagued by various issues: The app is a lot more stable than it used to be but still crashes pretty often. There are thousands of fake profiles literally 3/5 of everyone you swipe  then you get an instant match and some nonsense message about joining some website. Limited swipes make the above issue more of a problem as 40-60% of your swipes are going to robots so are wasted. Swipes don't seem to record correctly sometimes  I've gone 3 days without a match while constantly seeing people I swiped right re-appearing in my feed then other days get 10+ matches. Subscription is overpriced and the only rewards worth talking about are unlimited swipes and the re-roll last swipe option. Has a lot of potential but I feel a lot of it is wasted  still kinda feels like it's in beta stages.,March 01 2017,3

345281,468931,0f781253-039f-11e7-bc67-000c29dba5da,com.tinder,The concept is good but execution is lacking severely (as we can obviously see within other reviews); there are several HUGE issues with this app. The fact that I can't review my messages without my location being on (which runs down the battery)  even when I have selected to be hidden from matches is really stupid. If I am not discoverable  there is no need for my location to be on. Furthermore  the current login issues make the app almost useless. And Tinder  before you paste in your generic response  I work with technology so please save me the suggestion of updating my operating system. There is nothing outdated about my device  there is nothing I can modify within my settings or configurations. The only thing I will not do is download the Facebook app  which is what I believe the real issue is here. You should allow users to choose what apps they download  not lock users into downloading useless bloatware onto devices in order to use your service. Tinder already requires users to link a facebook account. Now I'm being pressured to link via the app. It's completely ridiculous and unnecessary. If these issues aren't fixed (which they likely won't be  because what company actually listens to the voices of end-users) Tinder's reviews will continue to drop just like the rest of these apps.,March 07 2017,1

346156,470024,58b07ec5-0796-11e7-af15-000c29dba5da,com.tinder,Overall this app is poorly made. When launching it with no internet it will disconnect you and force you to relogin upon reconnecting to a network  which is really inconvenient. Why doesn't it save the login info or automatically reconnect I don't understand. Next  chatting is usually alright  but it has its bugs  such as being unable to properly navigate chat history  click on links or phone numbers  and will sometimes save a draft of your message but most of the time it won't. It's also super annoying trying to type a profile. The typing seems to lag  in a way that you can input the letters  sit back  and watch them slowly pop up on the screen.,March 10 2017,2

That's not a bad thing - the Tinder model is mindless  but that's how it should be for dating apps  and it is far superior to the likes of OKCupid and Plenty of Fish  which ask all sorts of pointless personal questions under the pseudo-scientific justification they can find you better matches. A couple of points to note with this app - there are a lot of fake profiles on Tinder by spambots  and you should never respond to anyone's profile that asks you to contact them on something like Kik. They're usually trying to scam you or make you register for something.,March 16 2017,4

346883,470909,6334dcfe-0ab0-11e7-b5cf-000c29dba5da,com.tinder,Dear developers  Your app is good  however currently is experiencing an issue regarding group messaging. So when I match with a group  I can see the individuals there  however when I click on the circles that display their main picture  I am unable to go to their bio/view their profile. Essentially  all messaging functions work  however upon clicking the icons of the people I matched with and am talking to  I am unable to view their profiles. My assumption is that this is a minor flaw that's easily fixable  however it is annoying in that I can't look at them individually once I match. Upon resolving this matter  I will happily alter my review to that of a positive one.,March 16 2017,2

So when i see this happen as usual i exit back to the home inbox screen because sometimes it need to reload a guess but often when i do that i lose the match with that person entirely and our whole conversation. I highly doubt they are unmatching with me randomly lik that but if so then tinder should still allow you to read their last message even if they unmatched with you. I honestly think its a bug problem because often times i would exit out and open a conversation again and see a message that i didn't see before. Hopefully they can fix this.,March 19 2017,4

It's however an absolutely terribly developed app; one of the worst. I have hated my experience with Tinder and have always had issues. Not only from creating an account and having the texts sent  to matches being lost due to error  to the app not properly loading profiles  to the app simply not loading anything at all. I've tried everything from force closing the app  restarting the phone  clearing cache  changing distance/profile settings. Nothing works and the developers are completely negligent towards making the app actually usable or user friendly. It's obvious they are milking this for ads (with the increasing amount of them) and for the subscription revenue. I'd contact the support but they are not helpful whatsoever. They tell you to force close or update the app  uninstall and reinstall  etc... Never have I sufficiently been helped with any of the issues with my account.

The information that it displays doesn't link to anything so why can't you just fill it in manually? Basically  if tinder was more like okc it would be a lot better.,March 20 2017,1

No tinder cannot have access to my friends list  wall  all posts  messenger inbox  work history  pics  family members  and birth info. You should be able to create an account by entering what info you want to be open to the public. Not be forced to.

348106,472412,336ea6d0-15ab-11e7-9dbd-000c29dba5da,com.tinder,There seems to be a bug that is giving some users no matches despite a generous enough amount of swiping and time passed. A lot of googling has yielded many user-provided 'fixes' but so far none have worked. Uninstalling  deleting the account and starting anew  even with a new Facebook profile  doesn't work. Super likes  boosts  seem to have made zero difference. Even if the profile presentation was below average  which it isn't  the volume of likes and probability would surely amount to at least one match. It also seems like this issue  along with a sea of others  have been going on for years without being solved. The Tinder support I've found either gives you 'did you plug it in?' level copypasta  or nothing at all. I'd have hoped that with an app as popular as Tinder  there'd be more than enough resources  money and not least pride to try to make the app work properly. As it stands this just feels like a total waste of time and money.,March 30 2017,2

I ran out of swipes and decided to go premium for a month. After doing so I noticed there were no more matches to be found. The sheer likelihood of this happening (especially in populated city like Vancouver) is extremely improbable. I am fairly disappointed given I just paid for this app. For safe measure I switched my search radius to somewhere across the country. The same issue occurred. Either no one in Toronto has tinder  or this app is broken. I deleted and reinstalled this app  but the issue persisted. Anyone having this issue???,March 29 2017,1

Like every dating app I've tried  replies are few and far between. Therefore actually meeting someone through the app is rare (at least in my experience). Having said that  Tinder has some interesting / cool / unique features. The syncing with social media (showing mutual friends  etc) is handy. It allows you to display artists from your Spotify (though I wish this had more flexibility). The innovative swipe interface (at least it was innovative when it came out!). Anyways so I will give it four stars for functionality. If people replied more often it would hands down be the best dating app around. But they don't ;),March 31 2017,3

I'm not a stranger to your app I've used it several times and every single time that I've gotten back into Tinder it's always the same thing. 99% of all the female profiles that match up and send you a message are Bots  not real people and constantly send you links to sex apps. If you do not becoming a legitimate app that you claim to be with real people then I will simply report Tinder to Google Play and they can take the matter further removing Tinder entirely from Google Play.

When you contact support  we get a generic message that does not solve the technical problem. After reading a lot of people on websites who complain of encountering the same problem  I think that Tinder puts Facebook account or phone number in a blacklist to prevent bot spam.

It's famous inability to log on obviously makes the app useless to me  which is inexcusable. Every other app seems to use Facebook's API just fine. 90% of bots could be easily filtered out by just checking their bios for keywords. I love what you guys do  but honestly mediocre/5,April 09 2017,2

I'm not going to say I'm expecting tens or hundreds of matches but I don't believe my profile is horrendous enough to not get a single match in weeks.

Since I deleted my account  it is impossible to recreate a new account on Tinder application  an error message appeared on my screen : """"There was a problem getting your code. Please try again"""". It's a joke ? It works with Google  Microsoft  Facebook  Happn  banks and much more except Tinder. When you contact support  we get a generic message that does not solve the technical problem. After reading a lot of people on websites who complain of encountering the same problem  I think that Tinder puts Facebook account or phone number in a blacklist to prevent bot spam. I don't want to delete my Facebook account as Tinder is unable to solve this for years! Edit : It is confirmed that it will ban either the Facebook account or the phone number or the IP address when you delete your account. Edit 1 : It's a joke ! It does not work with other numbers  even sms online says nothing to receive. Always the same message: """"There was a problem getting your code. Please try again"""". Edit 2 : New Facebook account does not work with phone numbers and sms online. Edit 3 : I tried Tinder on another phone  I have the same message.

That's not a bad thing - the Tinder model is mindless  but that's how it should be for dating apps  and it is far superior to the likes of OKCupid and Plenty of Fish  which ask all sorts of pointless personal questions under the pseudo-scientific justification they can find you better matches. A couple of points to note with this app - there are a lot of fake profiles on Tinder by spambots  and you should never respond to anyone's profile that asks you to contact them on something like Kik. They're usually trying to scam you or make you register for something. Edit 12/04/2017: downvoting to 3 stars due to a massive wave of spam and fake profiles trying to scam you. Given you have only limited likes a day  this is pretty unacceptable  and Tinder needs to do more to clean up its profiles.,April 11 2017,3

This two or three at a time is ridiculous and a waste of time with constantly having to log in  especially when half the time it is people I already swiped left on. There is one guy I swipe left on at least twice a day. Also  constantly seeing profiles from people not even in my country. And Tinder definitely has an identity crisis now that it is also being promoted as a dating site with relationship potential  which is pissing people off on both sides. People looking for hookups are annoyed because people looking for relationships have ruined it  and people looking for dates and relationships are annoyed with getting nothing but matches looking for sex. Maybe Tinder needs to add a filter asking whether you are seeking a hookup  casual dating or a relationship  then only show people with the same intent.,April 11 2017,1

349423,474055,6ead3dbc-1f19-11e7-b7de-000c29dba5da,com.tinder,I met some really nice guys on here. I met a few guys who were very vulgar and upfront on what they wanted. You see  I think the key part that everyone who gives this a bad rep somehow misses is that this is social media. This is communication between peers or older adults. Communication that can create issues or unwanted attention if not expressed clearly. The vulgar guys never got a message back. For many reasons of course  but the biggest being the simple fact that I stated on my profile that I was looking for people to meet and talk to. I was clear and I didn't owe anyone anything. This is a great way to make friends and sometimes for entertainment purposes. I met a guy from VMI and attended his Homecoming Dance. Went to Taco Bell too many times lol. Made new Snapchat friends. Only one less a star because of the log in issues I seemed to have every once in a while.,April 10 2017,4

349608,474280,975dcd43-20ac-11e7-b9a0-000c29dba5da,com.tinder,The apps functionality and ergonomics are really good. Its the people on the app that ruin it. Tinder is only succesful for attractive people to find hookups been using tinder for like a year and all of matches either just umatched me or didnt respond probably becuase im not 6 foot with 6 pack and a uniform. But thats not tinders fault thats just how superficial people are.,April 13 2017,4

349611,474284,997d03ca-20ac-11e7-b9a0-000c29dba5da,com.tinder,Dont pay for tinder plus if your gender nonconforming or queer! This application allows users to ban others based on their gender identity. The worst part is that Tinder won't tell you that you're banned. Your matches will still be there and you can swipe matches but it will just look like no one wants to talk to you or no one new wants to match with you. However  then you swipe right on someone who super liked you and you still won't be able to match with them. This happened to me so I contacted customer support. When I first contacted Tinder they said it was a network issue on my end but after a few messages they admitted that my account was under review due to being reported by users because of my gender identity. I PAY FOR TINDER PlUS and kept paying without realizing I wasn't even able to use the app! They wouldn't have told me that my account was blocked and would have allowed me to keep paying for a service I was not able to use. They claim that anyone can use this service no matter there gender identity but allow people to report you because of it. I moved to a new area and this app is the only way I can meet new people. This is unfair discrimination.,April 13 2017,1

349958,474747,ef4fbb1e-2313-11e7-8e68-000c29dba5da,com.tinder,Although the app has basic functionalities  it is extremely unreliable. Queued profiles disappeard lately (people who liked you are shown first in 'people nearby' and they remain there if you don't swipe them)  location determination is way off and many matches never respond or unmatch directly. Those who respond the chatting often stops suddenly (and the match remains). They often stop responding after a new message notification but this message is not showing up in the Tinder app. Not sure they received my next message (probably not for the same reason) and it seems likely that unreliable message delivery is the cause of the sudden halt to a conversation. So you get teased with nice profiles  but when you get involved your success depends on the reliability of the Tinder app (and a bit less on meeting honest and real people).,April 16 2017,1

This application allows users to ban others based on their gender identity. The worst part is that Tinder won't tell you that you're banned. Your matches will still be there and you can swipe on people but it will just look like no one wants to talk to you or no one new wants to match with you. However  then you swipe right on someone who super liked you and you still won't be able to match with them. This happened to me so I contacted customer support. When I first contacted Tinder they said it was a network issue on my end but after a few messages they admitted that my account was under review due to being reported by users because of my gender identity. I PAY FOR TINDER PlUS and kept paying without realizing I wasn't even able to use the app! They wouldn't have told me that and would have allowed me to keep paying for Tinder Plus even though I'm not able to use the app. They claim that anyone can use this service no matter there gender identity but then allow people to report you because of it. I moved to a new area and this app is the only way I can meet new people. This is unfair discrimination.,April 18 2017,1

Because of this  most of your profile is unchangeable without editing facebook itself. You can't add interests without liking some FB group or page  it's basically a mess unless your entire life is devoted to FB  and for those of us without a FB  guess we'll just go f*** ourselves.

I don't even swipe anymore because I don't just want matches sitting there and waiting for their replies every month or so. Now  I'm deleting this app. It would also be nice to know the last time a person logged in  that way to know if you're being ignored and they're no longer interested or simply haven't logged in.

351214,476379,1e16a94e-2891-11e7-80ae-000c29dba5da,com.tinder,Terrible app. It uses an absurd amount of battery by constantly using the GPS to refresh in the background. My phone used to be able to make it through the day with more than 60% remaining and now I can't even make it through classes with light foreground use. Also  what's the point of an app like this if you can't send pictures to people? Huge flaw. The only reason I would consider using it is because it has an established user base. Hopefully something better will take its place soon.,April 22 2017,1

Not that your app is supposed to make me desireable (and you can see on my profile that I'm not a jerk)  but I really think something is both working in your programming.. I still see people in NY (even though I'm in MI)  I feel that the pool of people I see are all obvious 'bots'  people asking to get free money/food/whatever  or mismatched options for me. I used Tinder before and had more matches in a week then the last 2 months (a lot more). I've used two other similar apps and had matches within a week  and a date set up. Now the only reason I use it is to see if any of my friends pop up 😉 Sooo.. HUGE waste of time  and most likely  will not lead to love or hookups. ***** Zero matches in 3 weeks  wtf? I'm not being too picky  bc I tried swiping right on people who were just a 'maybe' and still no matches. I used your ap before and had many matches with an even pickier mindest  whats wrong with it now? Also  why do people from NY keep showing up in my list? My location is on and correct  but I get a mix that makes no sense (if it was one or two I wouldn't raise the question  but I get ppl from NY almost every 4th person. This so has gotten progressively worse  less interesting  and just another scam for money.. Send me $5 and see what happens- what the hell is that? Do these ppl realize that they are soliciting themselves? Also  why do you allow it? Bad experience all around  I'll give it one week before I uninstall and never come back.,April 21 2017,1

351659,476947,f804b9b7-2d1d-11e7-8745-000c29dba5da,com.tinder,This is really just a mediocre app that got lucky getting the most members. Right place and time  I guess. The UI is okay  but other than profile descriptions  the features are kind of odd  no one uses them. (Sending suggestions to friends?) 90% of bots could be easily filtered out by checking for keywords  but tinder clearly can't handle any more server weight. The app is permanently down. So who even cares anymore. I used to love what you guys do  but honestly pathetic/5,April 28 2017,1

Technically every female or whoever identifies as one received a generous right swipe over the course of a month. The pictures I used are basic and of a genuine person and a handsome man who has had sex with many women. But to no avail. Two replies. I figured the women here were actively looking.

351782,477109,69d2c9a9-2d1e-11e7-8745-000c29dba5da,com.tinder,This app is very useful for people who are new to an area or are just looking for a one night stand. Relationships out of this sometimes happen but it isn't always a garruntee when you both like each other obvcourse. In my opinion it is better to see the person in front of you rather than flirting over a app. if you want unlimited swipes and be able to super like (meaning they will know you super liked them and a banner will show up on your account before they Swipe) although $15 a month gets you 10 super likes a month I think  also you can rewind people by tapping the refresh key to the left. And tap the boost in the middle to put your face up over top of everyone else and when you swipe like on someone while the boost is activated they will see you first hand and even if they Swipe left you will come up again. Tinder needs to make some profit out of it so 15 a month is reasonable if you love tinder the go for it.,April 27 2017,5

So there is something fishy with the mechanim how profiles are listed. From the matches I got around 2/3 are unresponsive  unmatch directly or are fake profiles. Those matches who remain the chatting functionality is buggy sometimes: messages disappear on my side and/or some of my messages never get delivered.

Lower the distance settings and suddenly heaps more appear (how does that make sense?). Also  most accounts on there are scammers  cloned accounts using stolen info/pics  or else cam girls and prostitutes. User advice: Guys: Don't send dick pics you retards. Girls: Everyone loves their dog/cat and fun  think of something original. And no guy wants to see your duckface or puppy nose filtered pics. Single mums: Don't put that you live alone with your kids or put pics of your kids anywhere on the net or in apps. Seriously  it's dangerous  and almost as dumb as voting for Trump.,April 25 2017,2

352603,478211,6591c405-2f9a-11e7-8be7-000c29dba5da,com.tinder,PROS: It's a good app  really fun to use  and simple. CONS: It has a lot of shortcomings and limitations. For example  you don't have many options in terms of filtering for a specific type of person. Additionally  instead of listing your location  it actively tracks it. This means that if you go on vacation 2 000 miles away and you use Tinder  you'll match with people in that area  just to find out later that you live in different parts of the world  to the disappointment of both parties. TL;DR: It's great  and it's fun  but I'd recommend downloading OkCupid as well.,May 01 2017,4

352662,478301,a3fceb92-2f9a-11e7-8be7-000c29dba5da,com.tinder,Hated it. Had tinder for afew years now and always having issues. Recently messaged them 6 times in one week to fix a problem and it only worked for an hour and then the problem was back and cannot use the app at all. Alot of guys are very rude on here and girls are somewhat the same from what ive heard and egotistical. This site is filled with fuckboys and girls and bots. Good for a one night stand but dont be fooled like me who thought people wanted to date when they just said that to try and get in my pants. Be careful and wise while using this app. Again  good for a one night thing if the app doesnt crash  but not suitable as a dating app more just for hookups,May 01 2017,1

Im out 23 bux...yeah i know its only 23 bux but alot of dollars for an app that doesn't work...and to top it off.

Open it up  fail to log in. Reinstalled it countless times  restarted phone and the bit that annoys me is all they send in response is asking me to do what I have already done. Good app  useless reliability. I even pay for it  just in case you're wondering. This resolves nothing  just that you're now paying for an app that will work whenever it fancies. And the fact the staff 'seem' oblivious just insults me frankly I'll continue to use it  but I'll continue to be baffled a the uselessness of their connectivity,May 04 2017,3

352827,478538,da8a2d33-312c-11e7-8160-000c29dba5da,com.tinder,I've switched to Bumble and you should too....Why? Because: There's NO way to organize matches. New matches get thrown into the mix of old matches in a random order (which I have around 1000 of). Making it impossible to find recent connections. The list of matches is essentially a single file line of thumbnail sized circles  that if you click  will reset your place in the list. So you have to scroll through hundreds of tiny pics just to hopefully find where you left off(and then repeat over and over). This is a gamebreaking bug that needs to get fixed.... And maybe it's just an Android issue.

Update: The upgrades you get for paying for the app are absolutely worth it. Lately I have seen the bot count drastically reduced and I'm back to matching with 6 or 7 REAL people per day. Keep it up.

352849,478568,f203b2f0-312c-11e7-8160-000c29dba5da,com.tinder,I liked Tinder initially. But now I am not liking it at all. The way it works  after subscribing (paying) you get a boost option and only after using that  matches happens. But from the last few days  Tinder team had reduced the boost option from four a month to just one a month. So Tinder makes no sense now  as with one boost a month u could only have one or two matches. I understand and it's ok to charge money but in return the service should be satisfactory. Tinder team - I am not happy at all and might not continue if same approach is followed from your side.,May 03 2017,3

When you get a message the notification doesn't show its preview so you have to go to the app and it alias takes ages to load it. Same people I swiped left several times keep on appear over and over again. Can't filter your matches in any way so for instance if you have matches from different places  you can't find out which ones are close.

At times  it won't load the matches. And during specific period you're not supposed to get a single match while in other you get matches like 100s. Don't know what's the algorithm / AI behind this.

The app works well and I have had plenty of matches and some great conversations. The app is easy to use but there is a science to making sure you stand out the crowd.

353693,479698,112a0d44-36ad-11e7-8290-000c29dba5da,com.tinder,I think the recent update on the UI has made me super like more frequently by accident (5 in one hour!). This wasn't a problem before since I could just rewind but it doesn't work now! Not sure why this is happening but I think it occurs mostly when I view someone's profile in and out then exit out to swipe after. Not all bad though  the recent information overlay over the profile picture is a good addition to help influence people's choice more. I've had an easy time finding girls with the same interests as me and had really enjoying conversations. I recommend to have patience especially if you are someone like me who is nerdy and selective. My best tip is to not judge them by their front picture alone. I've done this before many times before changing my mind. View everything they've given if you are not sure because once you swipe left that's it  you will unlikely see them again. Understanding that not everyone is meant for each other is important too and what is the best for you both. Give a variety of pictures if you can from doing activities you like and make it clear who is you in them. Also make sure you know when a conversation should finish for the day so that it's not overdone and keeps it more fun the next time you talk. Everyone gets tired! Good luck everyone. 😉,May 10 2017,4

The swiping controls are too sensitive. Sometimes I swipe or super like when I'm really trying to open the profile. Sometimes I'm trying to swipe through photos and it goes back to the main screen and I end up swiping left on someone I may have wanted to swipe right on. Hard to believe these issues exist in such a mature app. Almost makes it seem like the issues are here on purpose to try and get us to purchase the add ons. Please fix this.,May 14 2017,2

When I first downloaded the app a few weeks ago I was getting a ton of matches  now it's a dead zone and always saying no one new. My city has 4 universities  don't tell me there is no one new. A friend of mine did a test where we liked each other  I sent her a message  she got it  she sent one back and I still haven't received it. I cleared cache  Uninstalled  removed it from Facebook  reinstalled  still nothing works. This app is not worth the cash until the developers fix whatever is wrong. They will quickly learn how businesses fail because their product does not deliver what's expected.,May 15 2017,2

354505,480707,eefce33a-3e91-11e7-951d-000c29dba5da,com.tinder,Tinder has been overrun by fake accounts. Maybe 1 in 10 matches is a real person and the rest are just fake accounts that match with you and send you a link to some website. I've never clicked one but I'm guessing they are links to either a cam girl website or paid adult website of some sort. Tinder needs to ask Bumble for help on how to filter that stuff out because Bumble does it right. I doubt girls deal with it as much but it's a real problem for guys.,May 21 2017,1

For the people giving good reviews it's BC you're new to the app when you first sign up you get constant connections but none of them will ever respond  or are bots.

355023,481359,24591d7b-44a2-11e7-b318-000c29dba5da,com.tinder,I believe you are getting too many complaints of users about not being matched with anyone  especially of male users . I know the exact reason . Most of the female users who use this app are just looking for attention . They dont wanna match with anybody . They only want their pics to be liked . Its not just happening on this app  its the story of every other social app Female users just seek attention but tinder is a Dating match app . So as a developer you need to deactivate those inactive ids (Either he is boy or a girl) who hasnt liked the profiles of other users and has been inactive for a long time. It would be the cleaning process and you will get better reviews and results. Take my opinion seriously .,May 29 2017,1

Its 2017  it shouldn't be that hard to be inclusive towards a community that is just like any other.

I used to be able to fly into a city and get a hookup on day one with tinder. I haven't gotten anything out of this app now for almost a year. I mostly just see fake profiles  and I'm pretty sure the location set up is up to 25 miles off. In fact  it thinks I'm still in Missouri after three days of being in South Texas. How bad are you guys at making apps? The profile text box has for three years been so broken you have to reload your profile page several times just to actually use it. You're going out of business  tinder  and it's not cos some other company came and took it  it's cos you suck. You suck really really bad  and your app is professionally laughable.,May 25 2017,1

Several critical issues of note: 7.0.0 brings a swipe limit for paid subscribers  despite numerous false advertisements for """"Unlimited Likes"""". Trying to click someone's phone number makes the chat log jump so the number is unclickable. Sometimes I have to try several dozens of times before the link randomly decides to work. Login issues still have not been fixed after dozens of updates and device changes. Usually occurs right when I'm setting up a promising date  naturally. How about making it not sign you out every time you have connection problems? Easiest fix ever  who knew?! Support is absolutely lazy and worthless  they paste a generic reply to reinstall or try again later and it NEVER solves the issue.

You've made it this far  so why not fix the login issue that every single user deals with constantly? You'll get better ratings and reviews if you do.
