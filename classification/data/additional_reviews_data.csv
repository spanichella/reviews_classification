1,b49b4291-afee-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,Pixel Dungeon,Astounding! One of my favorite rogue-likes of all time! Great gameplay  lots of different scenarios  no dungeon is ever the same! Great graphics! All you rogue-like fans  this game is a must have! Keep up the good work on this excellent game! *Edit* I did find a bug with the shop. When I made it to the shop It was much smaller than usual  and without a shopkeeper. Due to lack of a shopkeeper  I was able to pick up everything  free of charge. I'm guessing this wasn't meant to happen.,13.11.16,5,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

I'm amazed that the developer has not tried to make money on this. The developer even releases new content for FREE.

This is one of the few completely free games (no ads!) that are both professional and enjoyable.

12,e2492413-afee-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,Pixel Dungeon,Right now this game is Far to easy  item spawn rates are far to high. Also you should only be given 1 free food per five levels to make it more challenging. And item durability is terrible please remove it. BTW did you give up watabou?

13,e60a49d3-afee-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,Pixel Dungeon,A great time waster! Really fun  engaging  challenging roguelike game. Cool soundtrack and pixel art as well. You'll see some negative reviews complaining about item durability: they miss the point. The game is about resource management  so a powerful magic item will degrade more quickly. This brings balance to the game. By the way  I thought there was a bug causing keys not to generate. No spoilers  but it's a puzzle  not a bug ;-],17.09.16,5,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

21,16f3a6ff-afef-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,Pixel Dungeon,Fun and Challenging A great game which I recommend to anyone looking for a challenge. I've easily spent 30+ hours of my life playing so far and still haven't beaten it! But I still come back since its actually fun  brutal and (mostly) fair. Luck sometimes play a major part however  but thats only because of the nature of random generation and rougelike games. Other than that  its a great game which other free games on the app store should strive to be like.,15.08.16,4,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
22,18326894-afef-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,Pixel Dungeon,Too random Other reviews are lauding the difficulty but it's too based on chance. I've read forums and reddits that state the importance of a 'lucky start' and for me that's not good enough. Combat is often draining as you continually miss  items drop too infrequently and overall  after 30 failed starts I just realised I wasn't having fun.,14.08.16,2,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This game requires strategy and your brain power on solving puzzles and secrets. No no  I'm not going to tell anyone any secrets  this isn't what I'm writing for  I'm writing this because I'm thanking the developers for creating this game! Definitely a 10/5 star app! These are the type of games I am looking for  if I could donate a minimum of one million dollars I probably would! Oh and the main menu music is really nice!,08.08.16,5,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
27,2b81cc8c-afef-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,Pixel Dungeon,You can't go wrong A free game without DLC or annoying microtransactions - that alone places this enjoyable game in a rarefied air. After a couple of years of on-and-off play of this game  I finally managed to complete it; appropriately with a sliver of health remaining. It's frustrating  compelling  surprising and most importantly fun - like all Roguelikes it seems gruelling at the best of times and impossible at worst. Donated after I realised I was having a great time - worth every dollar  and then some. Cheers  Watabou.,04.08.16,4,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

31,3cf08999-afef-11e6-be22-b252784303c8,Pixel Dungeon,A fun addictive game. But  the gameplay is too short. If you encounter a wraith  all you see is 'wraith evaded you!' when you try and hit it. The game is beatifull and mystical  but as soon as you find something cool  like an enchanted battleaxe  potion ect  don't expect to have it for long. But the game is free  and the only purchase is a donation  unlike most apps that pressure you into buying powerups  ect with money.,30.07.16,4,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Under the primitive veneer is a sophisticated Dungeon crawler. Seems to have randomized levels as each time I die (and you will die in this game) and start over  the levels are different.

The gameplay is what you would expect from a rogue like; a challenging experience with variety and replayability. Some people may find the permadeath concept frustrating at first  but i think it works really well  especially on a mobile game. I think it the characters feel a little too similar in playstyle  but otherwise this game is very complete  rather bug free  and a very good game overall.,24.12.15,5,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0

And the game is really great and not repetitive because of random generation. It's quite difficult but challenging and rewarding  so If you haven't already got it download it now!

Even the underlying story is really good! The game as a whole brings about a feeling of nostalgia echoing from memories of plundering dungeons in the original legend of zelda.

No story  just go and explore. As dungeon is randomly generated  it has great replay value - everytime  it's a new dungeon to explore. But  this game is not for those looking for a story based progressive rpg. You will die many times and then you have to start again from lvl 1. Its really hard (nearly impossible) to complete it for many of us. Well  this is the main feature of rogue like games  so no blame..,02.12.15,3,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

There's little thrill in finding new items since even equipping unidentified equipment still leaves it unidentified! Also there isn't a hungry meter I can see?

I enjoy this game  I don't enjoy dying after ninety minutes in a good game. Ideas for additions: Add a 'throb entire screen red when hp is low (and maybe players can set the percent)'  space the buttons so the game can be played on devices with small screens without searching when trying to rest for one enemy's step  fix auto-pathing (it currently paths based on enemies that are not visible and steps back and forth when no path is available)  bugfix the autopathing arrow after a fight (frequently only advances one step or disappears without other actions)  fix the wand of reach (does not switch with enemies as the description states) and a few other things. Keep up the good work on adding things just don't forget the main priority is to have it function well. I am a person who likes to donate yet I do not appreciate improvements when known problems exist  it just compounds the issue and it is the reason software such as Windows exists with great feature bloat and so many bugs the average user is always upset about something.,11.08.15,1,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0
125,5629cfa0-bb05-11e6-813c-fa163e345ce9,Pixel Dungeon,PD Is amazing... But just one small complaint I've been playing Pixel Dungeon give or take about 4 years  and I loved it from the beginning. There was a point where I had a hard time keeping up with the game because of all of the updates that was over a year ago so I'm going to try it again. It has been a source of inspiration in my D&D play  and it has never ceased to keep me entertained  no matter how hard or easy I may find it. I especially enjoy a game that is well built  evenly balanced  and takes up less than 30 megabytes of information as if to say; I've been thinking about your Hardware  and I appreciate your patronage. The only time I've had a problem with this game glitching up was due to my own Hardware  completely irrelevant to this game. Except for every so often  I'll touch one part of the screen and my character will want to go the long way  or something out of the way of where I was attempting to go. I don't know if that's a hardware or software problem  but I've encountered it on multiple devices. Regardless this game is fun to play in my opinion. And for those of you with Android consider yourself lucky because you have to pay for it on Steam Powered and iOS all things considered I still think it's worth it!,05.12.16,5,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0

There should also be a shield  helmet  boots  gauntlets  and greaves added to the game so your character is better defended. A small shop should exist on levels 1-4. Rations for starvation level are not commonly found. Starvation feature should be taken out because its very annoying.

182,7c13e921-afc9-11e6-a90b-c4b301cdf627,ConnectBot,Great This app has made it extremely easy to make wake on lan and sleep on lan work in my situation. The best feature is the auto run after login commands  you can make simple scripts so you don't have to do any typing (for me it's to send a wakeup packet or run a couple powershell commands to sleep my computer). It's a little finicky with puttygen private keys  but that's easily solved by generating the keys in the app.,24.04.15,5,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

184,7c13f30c-afc9-11e6-a195-c4b301cdf627,ConnectBot,No trackball? No CTRL or ALT for you. Seems like a decent program  but suffers from the major design flaw of assuming that everyone's phone has a trackball. Do they even still make Android phones with trackballs? I can't remember seeing one in 5 years at least. But without such a button  there's no way to type CTRL or ALT characters  or activate function keys (or at least none I could find after about a half hour of playing with the app and googling). It seems like such a glaring oversight  and prevents this from being an awesome tool.,17.04.15,2,,,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Just one thing: If I am using it in portrait mode (95% of the time) the keyboard does not offer those buttons.

445,7c97b3fd-afc9-11e6-a200-c4b301cdf627,Amaze File Manager,I very much like the clean  intuitive  simple navigation of this file manager. I one issue I have and that is I am trying to figure out how to give write access to the external 128GB MicroSD card. When I try to copy/paste  or cut/paste objects from one location to the other I am being told I need to choose the root folder of the resource (external MicroSD card) and give it write permissions. But  no where is it clear as to how to do this. At least it is not obvious how to do so. One feature I would like to see is  the ability to copy/cut/paste files from my home network's computer  NAS  etc.  over WiFi to my Android device as well. Other then that  wonderful and simple file manager. A big thank you.,09.12.15,5,,,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

517,868cff48-f4a4-11e6-8dd5-000c29dba5da,Amaze File Manager,Thanks for the fast and lightweight manager. It can grow to take place of the ES of the past. Switched from ES because recently  it has become a spam and bloatware heavy app  and the top in battery draining list. Some bugs/suggestions: 1. Copy paste and cut paste notification stays on forever. Therefore next operation in queue won't start. 2. Have to set the default home tabs  each time I open the app. 3. Dual toolbar top (static) and bottom  would have been great. 4. The top ui bar should occupy less space  and be static with address  tabs  three line menu switch  etc. The dynamic style of it hinders easy copy pasting  directory switching etc 5. Grid view is not as comfortable as ES  cannot get the same experience even after adjusting the no of rows,16.02.17,3,,,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Only used it for a couple of hours  so don't know if there are other issues  but the biggest improvement for me would be supporting double-tap  when the widget is expanded to the full home screen. Double tap turns the screen on/off on LG G3  and it's one of my favorite Android features. To make it work  I need to leave some free area on the screen  but this means  I cannot display everything I want in the wizard.

Unfortunately on the S4/Note etc  Samsung ?stupidly? decided that you can't have a secured lock screen while having your own personal widgets like this. So you either have an unsecured lock which allows for widgets  easy camera access  or a secured lock which only allows for their boring clock and stupid/useless personal message crap? Why? Google has already designed lock screen widgets to work perfectly with a secure lock Samsung. This is why people like your phones but not your software.,16.08.14,5,,,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The playback stalls and freezes and plays intermittently  and won't allow me to 'come out' of the episode. The only way to do this is to close the app itself and open it again.

997,7c554cc7-afc9-11e6-bc36-c4b301cdf627,AcDisplay,1. WHEN USING LOCK SCREEN FUNCTION WITH PASSWORD CAMERA WILL NOT OPEN. If you want to use the AcDisplay lock screen and a pin  you simply enable AcDisplay on top of your stock lock screen. However  when opening camera from an off display using volume button shortcuts  AcDisplay will be in your way. Also  when using the AcDisplay camera shortcut  you will have to enter your pin before being able to use the camera (versus being able to use camera from the lock screen with the stock lock screen). 2. PHONES WITH FINGER SCANNERS MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY. Many phones such as the Honor 5x  Honor 8  Nexus 5x  and Nexus 6p have a fingerprint scanner that allows you to go from an off display directly to the home screen when your finger is scanned. You cannot do this with AcDisplay  as the AcDisplay lock screen will open up every time your phone is unlocked.,23.09.16,3,,,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I also want to see an update for fingerprint recognition to unlock the lockscreen because it defeats the purpose of having two lockscreens active to enter homescreen.,07.06.16,3,,,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

1058,7c56b1f5-afc9-11e6-a72d-c4b301cdf627,AcDisplay,AcDisplay brings the Active Display mode from Moto devices in a free open source app. The basic feature of this app allows the device's screen to turn when a notification appears and to quickly and easily interact with the notifications. There are 2 other options as well  making this app serve as a lock screen and/or turn on the screen based on device sensors. The overall design is very much minimalistic with a great looking design  and there are also plenty of settings to customize to fit your liking.

Also  custom apps/shortcut/actions for the corner gestures would be very useful too. No reason to limit those to phone and camera only. :P And lastly  an option to display ongoing notifications (maybe below the higher priority ones) would be nice too.,17.03.16,4,,,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

About 1 month ago  mostly right after unlocking the screen and sometimes randomly  the display tilts/shifts with an absurd angle and goes grayscale and then shortly after phone freezes  makes me do a hard reset. I thought it was a phone problem because I hadn't installed a new app. But then I thought maybe it's about this app  because it happened mostly after unlocking.

Is there a way to hide it on AcDisplay?

Looks so much better than the stock lockscreen. I've noticed a couple of bugs:the swipe animation freezes sometimes  and the clock has a lag in updating the time when the screen turns on.

You can't set custom shortcuts for unlock areas that aren't just dialer/camera (what about SMS? or a custom activity?). It doesn't seem to block the home button if you have your system lock screen disabled. If you *don't* disable your system lock screen  it takes about 5 seconds for AC display to appear when you wake up your phone.

It would be great to use the finger sensor with the AcDisplay and bypass the default lockscreen altogether from Active Mode.

Sometimes when I am typing  I discover nothing is appearing in the dialogue box. Other times I get 4 or 5 letters typed out  but it just freezes up. I have to tap the dialogue box to wake it up.

1233,7c7c3f1e-afc9-11e6-95d7-c4b301cdf627,Duck Duck GO,Clunky and polky I love Duckduckgo ( DDG ) application on my laptops and other devices. It's my 1st choice. Not so with the DDG search and stories app for android. Too cluttered and slow. Sorry DDG I miss the streamlined clear search engine I am accustomed to using. I gave it a fair shot. Even when I load the small window widget it is still much slower than Google app. Also the voice commands with my android are not seamless. I lose some of the hands free utility. IX QUICK is better but still about on par with DDG. So sad,14.08.16,3,,,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

It not only protects your privacy completely when searching for and accessing a website  if you take the time and look  it'll tell you all about why you shouldn't trust other search engines (my words  DuckDuckGo doesn't put it quite that way.)

I did get another Samsung and gave the old one to my son  who uninstalled all my apps. He is not having any crashes. I suggested this app to my friend who noticed phone issues and has since installed. (She has the same phone as I.) So now  I too have uninstalled and am having way fewer issues.

Been testing several and even looking for a customizeable one instead of making my own that switches themes would be nice.I bet who ever is behind DDG is LeGit!... If you feel like being more secure and standing up for the 4th? Amndt. You could always grab a Tor and Torfox along with DDG. I hear it gives the FBI rights to track you though..whocares. Also DDG is fastest and smoothest SE of the ones Ive tried so far. Simular to StartPage which I like the idea of old google devs making DDG has obviously made some improvements  Ive saved enough time so far like my unknown spurs fan down their callin scroogle for what it seems to be nowadays to write you guys my lovliest and longest review Evr!

Hopefully on you next update  it's something to do with group messaging. Like most messaging apps  when sending a message to multiple people  aside from it showing on each receiver's thread  every message should be found in one thread so I don't need to retype the names of my receivers in every message I wish to send by group. I tried several messaging apps available in Google play store and even the default messaging app of my Sony Xperia C3 failed me in sending group messages for they can't cater long messages that are mostly sent in group  it keeps prompting error messages before a message is successfully sent. And I'm hoping that this messaging app is not like that. With your next update  hopefully you'll have several options for font styles like the choco cooky font style of Samsung phones for that's actually my frustration in my phone (At least I can achieve it through this messaging app). I really love this app that's why I'm making an effort to help in its improvement. Kudos QKSMS team!,03.12.15,5,,,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Theres NO notification of received MMS when data is disabled. When going back into the app when i have a new sms the sms doesnt show up  its blank.

However small bugs really detract from the overall experience. Sometimes SMS and MMS messages from one contact will temporarily appear in another conversation if you quickly switch conversations. Also  entire conversations sometimes temporarily disappear when opening the app through quick reply. It's these small clunky bugs that really hold this app back from being one of the best.

But there are a couple big issues for me: 1) Auto night mode is not consistent  and the text does not change to a contrasting color without backing out of or force restarting the app. 2) MMS works well  for receiving messages  but they are displayed as this ludicrously small slide show at the top of the screen.

Not as much customization as others but that's fine...I do appreciate not being overwhelmed with endless options. I just wished one of the features I really use (delayed timer on messages sent) worked properly. From what I understand it has to be enabled before EVERY sent message...and even at that it still doesn't delay anything (even if I set the delay at 30 sec in the settings). It is a totally free/ad free app though...so I will stop complaining... Thks devs!!,27.01.17,4,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0

1754,9798c8c5-20a3-11e7-b9a0-000c29dba5da,QKSMS - Open Source SMS & MMS,This is a very useful application with only a couple of problems. First off  it needs to give the option to click on a contact name when starting a new message conversation. It is very annoying to have to manually enter a phone number that already exists in your contact list. Secondly  it needs to give the option to attach files not just access the gallery. I prefer personally to attach photos directly from my file manager and it will not allow for this. Other than that it is a very useful application. I love the dark and app and black themes period I am legally blind so having a dark theme is a must.

This only requires about 20 mins every morning. The app works very well  I can confirm that. You need to create the cards using the (free open source) computer program  it is not possible to create the cards using the app. Card creation is the initial part of the learning process  and you end up with cards that you have created for your needs.

1777,7cdb2651-afc9-11e6-9049-c4b301cdf627,AnkiDroid Flashcards,Useful  but the Android and PC Desktop versions of this software are missing many of the useful editing features available to iPhone/Apple users. You can waste a lot of time watching tutorials  hoping that they will get around to mentioning the existence of Android or PC or showing the non-Apple/iPhone interfaces (spoiler: they don't). And you can waste a lot of time trying to find the missing features you saw in the tutorials  (spoiler: they are not there). Finally  you can search their manual and supporting documentation for some sort of acknowledgement that these features are missing form the Android/PC versions of the software  so you can allow yourself to stop searching in vain and go to bed  but this search will be fruitless too. So  if you want an intelligent program training you on flashcards using spaced repetition  and you don't mind that you can do only the most nominal of editing of the cards themselves  this one is for you.

1781,7cdb56b8-afc9-11e6-b17b-c4b301cdf627,AnkiDroid Flashcards,Terrific app! Thanks to all who work on it. Two small requests: 1. The language I'm learning uses three fairly obscure characters: ®´ ®_ ®ö. These show up fine on the desktop version  but render as blank spaces or a ? on the app. These misrenders then get synced back onto the database. Is there a chance this could get fixed  or should I go ahead and find alternate characters to represent them? 2. One of the advantages of a mobile app flashcard system is that you can easily create audio flashcards in the field. The current app requires five touches to record audio (+  Add  paperclip  record audio  RECORD). It would be great to be able to do this in fewer steps  though I realize that might not be possible without overcrowding the interface.,13.07.16,5,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

I wish I could see all of my cards in a deck in a list so I could choose which to look at. I wish I could make decks on my computer and there were a way to synch them on my phone through an account. I wish the push notifications would send when cards are due  and not only when I actually open the app. What use is that? I wish the push notifications didn't resend any time my screen turns off in the middle of studying a deck. I wish there were some pre-made decks for students in popular subjects such as anatomy or psychology or languages. Maybe charge a dollar for access to pre made decks. It would really be worth it  because making flashcards for anatomy consumes way more time than I can afford  really  but I have to do it.,05.03.16,3,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

It is extremely flexible and offers countless ways to customize your deck. I personally prefer to create the cards on my desktop and sync with my portable devices. Include pictures and sound with your cards  enable the whiteboard to write your answers  require that the answer be typed in  create cloze cards etc. You can even create multiple cards with one click: forwards/backwards/spelling or use it to have one image with several labeled parts  each part with its own card. If you don't want all of this  you can also just keep your cards simple.

Once i got my head around templates and different types  i got myself to design few common types i use most and bang! Adding actual flashcards now using the templates is as simple as it can be ....

Today I am happy to report that AnkiDroid does exactly what I wanted. Adding cards is easy; the review interface is streamlined and practical to use with one thumb; and it does a good job of showing the cards I am struggling with. Synchronization between AnkiDroid (on a phone and a tablet)  the desktop app  and the web site all works smoothly. The navigation in the AnkiDroid UI confused me somewhat when I first starting using it. For example  the back button moves up to a higher level in the app structure  rather than returning you to the previous screen  which is fine but unexpected. Once I got used to the layout it works well.,22.07.14,5,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

But  I think the app lacks some features  like: 1- Some times I need to exclude some decks from the search process  but this feature is not there. 2- I cant """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""multi select"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" items in the search list  as sometimes i need to delete many cards  and takes alot!!! of time to do it. 3- Seems perfect if it is enabled to merge decks.

So I tried saying I got all them wrong so I could review then whenever I wanted. After you get more than one wrong it will just constantly go back to the words you got wrong; preventing you from practicing other. It also goes in the order that they were added. So as I'm reviewing them more and more  because of memory I can see one word and know what the next word will be.,23.05.14,2,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

To elaborate  I started off with only ankidroid and was instantly won over by its usefulness. I then decided to make my own deck on the pc version. This is where the program breaks down there is no way to simply add a deck from anki pc to ankidroid without completely overwriting all progress and cards on ankidroid.

The really big drawback is that it drains battery. I read online that battery monitor apps have to examine and get information from the battery frequently  thus draining it faster. I'll stay away from it now  for i do not know if there will be long term effects on the battery. It's a very nice and informative app though. :),15.06.14,4,,,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
