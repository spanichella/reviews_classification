Great gameplay  lots of different scenarios  no dungeon is ever the same! Great graphics! All you rogue-like fans  this game is a must have! Keep up the good work on this excellent game! *Edit* I did find a bug with the shop. When I made it to the shop It was much smaller than usual  and without a shopkeeper. Due to lack of a shopkeeper  I was able to pick up everything  free of charge. I'm guessing this wasn't meant to happen.

There are no ads  no in app purchases  and no shady permissions. I'm amazed that the developer has not tried to make money on this. The developer even releases new content for FREE. If the developer makes another paid game in future they have my purchase.

This is one of the few completely free games (no ads!) that are both professional and enjoyable.

Also you should only be given 1 free food per five levels to make it more challenging. And item durability is terrible please remove it. BTW did you give up watabou? You haven't updated since December.

Cool soundtrack and pixel art as well. You'll see some negative reviews complaining about item durability: they miss the point. The game is about resource management  so a powerful magic item will degrade more quickly. This brings balance to the game. By the way  I thought there was a bug causing keys not to generate. No spoilers  but it's a puzzle  not a bug ;-]

Pixel dungeon is a very well made dungeon crawler game. And don't even get me started on the difficulty. Getting through 25 floors without dying once? Piece of cake!

I've easily spent 30+ hours of my life playing so far and still haven't beaten it! But I still come back since its actually fun  brutal and (mostly) fair. Luck sometimes play a major part however  but thats only because of the nature of random generation and rougelike games. Other than that  its a great game which other free games on the app store should strive to be like.

I've read forums and reddits that state the importance of a 'lucky start' and for me that's not good enough. Combat is often draining as you continually miss  items drop too infrequently and overall  after 30 failed starts I just realised I wasn't having fun.

This game requires strategy and your brain power on solving puzzles and secrets. No no  I'm not going to tell anyone any secrets  this isn't what I'm writing for  I'm writing this because I'm thanking the developers for creating this game! Definitely a 10/5 star app! These are the type of games I am looking for  if I could donate a minimum of one million dollars I probably would! Oh and the main menu music is really nice!

After a couple of years of on-and-off play of this game  I finally managed to complete it; appropriately with a sliver of health remaining. It's frustrating  compelling  surprising and most importantly fun - like all Roguelikes it seems gruelling at the best of times and impossible at worst. Donated after I realised I was having a great time - worth every dollar  and then some. Cheers  Watabou.

If you encounter a wraith  all you see is 'wraith evaded you!' when you try and hit it. The game is beatifull and mystical  but as soon as you find something cool  like an enchanted battleaxe  potion ect  don't expect to have it for long. But the game is free  and the only purchase is a donation  unlike most apps that pressure you into buying powerups  ect with money.

For such a small game (especially on a phone where I don't expect actual fun most of the time)  I find myself playing a lot of this. -The only problem I have found so far is the food mechanic. It seems arbitrary as to how much it fills you up  but it never lasts very long. I always seem to be starving by mid level 2-3 of each run.

It is so hard to find a good dung/mob/slash and hack game out there. This is a game for true strategist's and expert dungeon delvers. I say bravo. I have yet to beat it personally but I've been to floor 18 with all three classes before I met my demise. Bravo on this game guys! Keep them coming!! Just saying there should be a save option though.

This is one tough roguelike game. Under the primitive veneer is a sophisticated Dungeon crawler. Seems to have randomized levels as each time I die (and you will die in this game) and start over  the levels are different. Possibly the best free game on Google play. It runs solid on my Android 4.4.1 running tablet too. No problems with it so far.

The interface is intuitive and nonobtrusive. The gameplay is what you would expect from a rogue like; a challenging experience with variety and replayability. Some people may find the permadeath concept frustrating at first  but i think it works really well  especially on a mobile game. I think it the characters feel a little too similar in playstyle  but otherwise this game is very complete  rather bug free  and a very good game overall.

No stupid in app purchases (it doesn't have them  Play Store said so because you can make a completely optional donation) no ridiculous waiting times  no ads  no pay walls. And the game is really great and not repetitive because of random generation. It's quite difficult but challenging and rewarding  so If you haven't already got it download it now! Please don't rate it bad for permadeath. It's a roguelike.

The interface is perfect  the graphics are great to look at  and (most importantly) the gameplay is unmatched by any other mobile game  free or paid.

It's suprisingly in-depth  ad free  strategic  and addicting in the best way possible. Even the underlying story is really good! The game as a whole brings about a feeling of nostalgia echoing from memories of plundering dungeons in the original legend of zelda. Really difficult until you figure out that you don't mess with giant piranhas EVER. My only regret is finding this game the week before finals. This game has made me question my decision to prioritize college over anything else. 10/10

Great game if you want to have some fun in spare time and don't want to give up much memory. No story  just go and explore. As dungeon is randomly generated  it has great replay value - everytime  it's a new dungeon to explore. But  this game is not for those looking for a story based progressive rpg. You will die many times and then you have to start again from lvl 1. Its really hard (nearly impossible) to complete it for many of us. Well  this is the main feature of rogue like games  so no blame..

At first Pixel Dungeon looks like a more modern version of dungeon cralwers of the past  but it suffers just like a large amount of them did from random combat  unintuitive game mechanics(potion making comes to mind)  and lots of instant death frustration. There's little thrill in finding new items since even equipping unidentified equipment still leaves it unidentified! Also there isn't a hungry meter I can see? Pixel Dungeon exibits some of the least fun dungeon cralwing mechanics in recent memory.

Run into a wraith level 2? Goodbye. All they ask is donations  no IAP that I've seen. Can be frustrating  but if you don't want to be frustrated  find a different genre. It's a little hard to pickup  could use a tutorial.

Either not finding healing items or not knowing if your randomized potion/scroll will help or hurt. Moving to combat is clunky and often gives the ai a free swing. Fun but too much luck involved.

Move the 'no' away from creatures or set a delay please. I enjoy this game  I don't enjoy dying after ninety minutes in a good game. Ideas for additions: Add a 'throb entire screen red when hp is low (and maybe players can set the percent)'  space the buttons so the game can be played on devices with small screens without searching when trying to rest for one enemy's step  fix auto-pathing (it currently paths based on enemies that are not visible and steps back and forth when no path is available)  bugfix the autopathing arrow after a fight (frequently only advances one step or disappears without other actions)  fix the wand of reach (does not switch with enemies as the description states) and a few other things. Keep up the good work on adding things just don't forget the main priority is to have it function well. I am a person who likes to donate yet I do not appreciate improvements when known problems exist  it just compounds the issue and it is the reason software such as Windows exists with great feature bloat and so many bugs the average user is always upset about something.

But just one small complaint I've been playing Pixel Dungeon give or take about 4 years  and I loved it from the beginning. There was a point where I had a hard time keeping up with the game because of all of the updates that was over a year ago so I'm going to try it again. It has been a source of inspiration in my D&D play  and it has never ceased to keep me entertained  no matter how hard or easy I may find it. I especially enjoy a game that is well built  evenly balanced  and takes up less than 30 megabytes of information as if to say; I've been thinking about your Hardware  and I appreciate your patronage. The only time I've had a problem with this game glitching up was due to my own Hardware  completely irrelevant to this game. Except for every so often  I'll touch one part of the screen and my character will want to go the long way  or something out of the way of where I was attempting to go. I don't know if that's a hardware or software problem  but I've encountered it on multiple devices. Regardless this game is fun to play in my opinion. And for those of you with Android consider yourself lucky because you have to pay for it on Steam Powered and iOS all things considered I still think it's worth it!

There should also be a shield  helmet  boots  gauntlets  and greaves added to the game so your character is better defended. A small shop should exist on levels 1-4. Rations for starvation level are not commonly found. Starvation feature should be taken out because its very annoying. Rations should have the ability to provide healing for 5-7 seconds Hidden doors should be easier to find. I'm glad I uninstalled this festering garbage of a videogame. :)

The best feature is the auto run after login commands  you can make simple scripts so you don't have to do any typing (for me it's to send a wakeup packet or run a couple powershell commands to sleep my computer). It's a little finicky with puttygen private keys  but that's easily solved by generating the keys in the app.

Seems like a decent program  but suffers from the major design flaw of assuming that everyone's phone has a trackball. Do they even still make Android phones with trackballs? I can't remember seeing one in 5 years at least. But without such a button  there's no way to type CTRL or ALT characters  or activate function keys (or at least none I could find after about a half hour of playing with the app and googling). It seems like such a glaring oversight  and prevents this from being an awesome tool.

Administrating my server  playing with my raspi - this app is perfect if combined with Hacker's Keyboard (it features alt  tab  arrow buttons and F1-F12). Just one thing: If I am using it in portrait mode (95% of the time) the keyboard does not offer those buttons. Could you or let me freely configure my hardware buttons for this app (volume down = F2  Volume up = F3 for example)  or offer extra-on-screen-buttons yourself? You would help me a lot!

Additionally  there's tickets dated way back in 2011 and 2010 that have people questioning how to import private keys from their SD card and this is still an issue. Ridiculous. I felt pretty confident that this would work considering the amount of downloads; however  there's so much in here that seems broken or half-assed.

But I have uninstall and reinstall the program before it will even hold new selections. When this is fixed  5 stars. Till then I'm giving 1 to get attention to this issue.

Getting a surprise wallpaper is so enjoyable. And the best part is that I can set personal family photos  but  due to the tasteful blur  no one else can really see them unless they know to double tap. So  I get to look at changing personal family photos every time I use my phone  but I don't have to worry about strangers or coworkers seeing family every time I use my phone in public. 5 stars. Best app on my phone.

Thanks Roman. Would it not be easier for the default to be focussed and peeps can then blur it if they want? Don't quite know why they would want to  but appreciate different strokes for different folks. Thanks again. P.s. could you make it storable on SD card rather than internal memory  as when peeps internal phones become full they may have to lose this App.

It still has some good features that you typically only see in paid apps so that's definitely cool to see. The material design interface is also aesthetically pleasing and easy to navigate.

Please ensure stability especially while moving  copying files.

I one issue I have and that is I am trying to figure out how to give write access to the external 128GB MicroSD card. When I try to copy/paste  or cut/paste objects from one location to the other I am being told I need to choose the root folder of the resource (external MicroSD card) and give it write permissions. But  no where is it clear as to how to do this. At least it is not obvious how to do so. One feature I would like to see is  the ability to copy/cut/paste files from my home network's computer  NAS  etc.  over WiFi to my Android device as well. Other then that  wonderful and simple file manager. A big thank you.

Switched from ES because recently  it has become a spam and bloatware heavy app  and the top in battery draining list. Some bugs/suggestions: 1. Copy paste and cut paste notification stays on forever. Therefore next operation in queue won't start. 2. Have to set the default home tabs  each time I open the app. 3. Dual toolbar top (static) and bottom  would have been great. 4. The top ui bar should occupy less space  and be static with address  tabs  three line menu switch  etc. The dynamic style of it hinders easy copy pasting  directory switching etc 5. Grid view is not as comfortable as ES  cannot get the same experience even after adjusting the no of rows

(Still works as desktop widget.) AFAIK  it would require xposed framework and root to work. This is not dev's fault  but should be made clear. (If it can be made to work  he deserves more than five stars.) If you don't like it  complain to Google - my view is that apart from technical improvements  it's downhill after jb.

Only used it for a couple of hours  so don't know if there are other issues  but the biggest improvement for me would be supporting double-tap  when the widget is expanded to the full home screen. Double tap turns the screen on/off on LG G3  and it's one of my favorite Android features. To make it work  I need to leave some free area on the screen  but this means  I cannot display everything I want in the wizard. Would be lot more user-friendly  if the widget just passed the double-tap signal to the OS.

Unfortunately on the S4/Note etc  Samsung ?stupidly? decided that you can't have a secured lock screen while having your own personal widgets like this. So you either have an unsecured lock which allows for widgets  easy camera access  or a secured lock which only allows for their boring clock and stupid/useless personal message crap? Why? Google has already designed lock screen widgets to work perfectly with a secure lock Samsung. This is why people like your phones but not your software.

All the 3rd party extensions make it very flexible. Also  it made some small apps redundent so I got to delete them. It would be nice if android allowed you to set lock screen widgets to use the full screen though. Not the apps fault but would improve things.

It doesn't auto-update  but that's okay. I've yet to lock it up. Another plus  it can search ITunes for podcasts.

A lil refinement needed  I looked far and wide for an ad free podcast app  and this meets that requirement and so many more! You can search and add podcasts from iTunes directly. Only thing I wish was different is to be able to delete downloaded podcasts directly from the episode interfaces

The playback stalls and freezes and plays intermittently  and won't allow me to 'come out' of the episode. The only way to do this is to close the app itself and open it again. Having said that  I have tried a few podcast apps on my android phone and this has suited me better than those up until the recent issues  so I will probably continue to use it and hope that updates resolve the problem

Setup takes a bit longer in antenna pod than stitcher  but this app actually stores podcasts to sd card rather than holding then in the phones ram.

Starting from adding your first podcast  the GPodder integration means you will probably never have to search for an XML file again  since it will already be searchable in the gpodder directory. Other useful features include a sleep timer  excellent crash recovery (though crashes aren't that frequent)  and headphone awareness. I'd recommend giving it a try before throwing a few bucks to another Podcatcher.

My only criticism is that I wish that the controls (play  pause  etc.) buttons were larger.

If you want to use the AcDisplay lock screen and a pin  you simply enable AcDisplay on top of your stock lock screen. However  when opening camera from an off display using volume button shortcuts  AcDisplay will be in your way. Also  when using the AcDisplay camera shortcut  you will have to enter your pin before being able to use the camera (versus being able to use camera from the lock screen with the stock lock screen). 2. PHONES WITH FINGER SCANNERS MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY. Many phones such as the Honor 5x  Honor 8  Nexus 5x  and Nexus 6p have a fingerprint scanner that allows you to go from an off display directly to the home screen when your finger is scanned. You cannot do this with AcDisplay  as the AcDisplay lock screen will open up every time your phone is unlocked.

I've searched for some app to show small and compact notifications after upgrade from Kitkat 4.4.4 to Lollipop 5.0.2 on my Sony Xperia Z3 compact. Despite this beauty works smooth  it only makes things worse: to unlock a mobile I need to make FOUR actions: press power button  swipe AcDisplay screen  swipe my unlock pattern. This is just ridiculous!

I also want to see an update for fingerprint recognition to unlock the lockscreen because it defeats the purpose of having two lockscreens active to enter homescreen.

Right now  it is about four seconds but I really want to be able to wave my hand over my phone. Second  I would like to have my phone behave as a clock full time when it is plugged in  and keep AC Display on.

There are 2 other options as well  making this app serve as a lock screen and/or turn on the screen based on device sensors. The overall design is very much minimalistic with a great looking design  and there are also plenty of settings to customize to fit your liking. AcDisplay is great for those wanting to view notifications quickly with a minimal and usable design.

There are just a few small changes that would make a WORLD of improvement  IMO  such as allowing more than one widget (there's plenty of space  why limit it?)  allowing widgets to be wider (again  the space is there  why the limit?)  being able to have widgets without overriding the stock clock  and being able to reposition the clock/widgets and maybe notification icons too. Also  custom apps/shortcut/actions for the corner gestures would be very useful too. No reason to limit those to phone and camera only. :P And lastly  an option to display ongoing notifications (maybe below the higher priority ones) would be nice too.

About 1 month ago  mostly right after unlocking the screen and sometimes randomly  the display tilts/shifts with an absurd angle and goes grayscale and then shortly after phone freezes  makes me do a hard reset. I thought it was a phone problem because I hadn't installed a new app. But then I thought maybe it's about this app  because it happened mostly after unlocking. So i disabled it and the problem solved. Hope this gets fixed. Cheers

Only complaints are with lollipop's new lock screen (wish it could go straight to pattern lock rather than slide) The design is elegant and a beautiful way of showing notifications  much cleaner than the lollipop notifications. There is one thing I'd love to have implemented: music control. Would it be possible for you to choose to play/pause/fwd/back depending on what controls are in the notification?

Is there a way to hide it on AcDisplay? Also it provides a bit of insecurity as anyone could just wake my phone and see incoming messeges (I use the lockscreen option)| Second: Why should your app take too much ram so it surely uses the CPU in the background taking up battery.. or am I wrong?

Looks so much better than the stock lockscreen. I've noticed a couple of bugs:the swipe animation freezes sometimes  and the clock has a lag in updating the time when the screen turns on. The only thing I didn't like was how I could only add one widget  and that when I did  it covered the clock. Other than that - great!

You can't set custom shortcuts for unlock areas that aren't just dialer/camera (what about SMS? or a custom activity?). It doesn't seem to block the home button if you have your system lock screen disabled. If you *don't* disable your system lock screen  it takes about 5 seconds for AC display to appear when you wake up your phone. It doesn't report widget size to widgets  so many can't work properly.

It would be great to use the finger sensor with the AcDisplay and bypass the default lockscreen altogether from Active Mode. Visually  AcDisplay is a beauty and has some really nice functionality  however performance is unstable and the integration with the OS is not great.

I just wish there was the ability to leave the screen on longer (until I dismiss  1 hour  etc)  maybe contact photos for notifications  proximity sensors  and shortcuts on lock screen. Also  it seems to not play well with Textra. When I get a text message  it will flash the screen on  then turn off and on until I open the notification. I have tried changing the priorities and all other options.

Could be far better.

It's my 1st choice. Not so with the DDG search and stories app for android. Too cluttered and slow. Sorry DDG I miss the streamlined clear search engine I am accustomed to using. I gave it a fair shot. Even when I load the small window widget it is still much slower than Google app. Also the voice commands with my android are not seamless. I lose some of the hands free utility. IX QUICK is better but still about on par with DDG. So sad

However  for an app which shouldn't be doing much  ddg seems to drain an awful lot of battery. In terms of consumption  it's often top 5 and sometimes third behind Screen & Android system  even on days I don't use it. At best that's a waste  at worst it makes me suspicious!

The inbuilt browser is capable and seamless. Respects privacy. The bangs are epic. Forget all other search engines  including Google. Just one quirk. There's no verb form for it. It's difficult to say I'll duckduckgo it. But I can definitely live with that. Great job guys. PS: the inbuilt tor support works effortlessly  provided you have orbot installed.

Doesn't need Stories and additional fluff; just do one thing and do it supremely. Still  a superb tool.

I have nothing to hide  but I cannot accept wholesale breach of individual freedom. Google has a lot to hide. Google is a shadow wing of US State Department. That's why NSA continues its mass surveilance operations with the support of mega corporations. This app lets us behave differently  individually  with our freedom in our own hands. SALUTE and SOLIDARITY.

At least a small positive in this seedy mess is that the people that have been working to protect everyone's privacy finally get some major recognition. I'm just happy I can shop for pressure cookers without a visit from my friendly government safety enforcer.

It's often the rampant tracking  add-ons  snoopery  that are running in the background that makes up for 99% of the BS that drags your device down. What was once within acceptable standards for tracking has only grown into something totally deplorable and cancerous to culture. DuckDuckGo is currently by far one of the better options available that abide within respectable grounds.

I use it on my home laptop pc  so thought to add it to my smartphone. I have a Samsung with ATT service. I think this app has caused most of my phone stall and crash problems. My old Samsung phone was so bad that the co permitted me to upgrade early. I did get another Samsung and gave the old one to my son  who uninstalled all my apps. He is not having any crashes. I suggested this app to my friend who noticed phone issues and has since installed. (She has the same phone as I.) So now  I too have uninstalled and am having way fewer issues. Suggestion: If you install and notice slowing  crashes  or other issues  this app may be the problem.

Thanks everyone Been skeptical with everything thats been going on for awhile now. checking out DDG awhile back and was very interested. Been testing several and even looking for a customizeable one instead of making my own that switches themes would be nice.I bet who ever is behind DDG is LeGit!... If you feel like being more secure and standing up for the 4th? Amndt. You could always grab a Tor and Torfox along with DDG. I hear it gives the FBI rights to track you though..whocares. Also DDG is fastest and smoothest SE of the ones Ive tried so far. Simular to StartPage which I like the idea of old google devs making DDG has obviously made some improvements  Ive saved enough time so far like my unknown spurs fan down their callin scroogle for what it seems to be nowadays to write you guys my lovliest and longest review Evr! Thx DDG. I just really like it. Now send me some customizable widgets!!!!!

It's a simple yet beautiful app that's also pretty snappy. I'm giving it 4 stars though because notifications are kind of hit or miss. Sometimes they work perfect  sometimes the sound works but there's no notification  and sometimes nothing comes up at all. I think if this is fixed  it will definitely be the best sms app out there! EDIT: This is more of a suggestion  but the proximity sensor feature is way too sensitive.

However  there are two important functions that I still yet to get from this app. Firstly  Android phones commonly have dual sim cards and this app doesn't have the option for users to choose from which sim card they're sending the message from. Second  it doesn't have the option to directly save a contact from within the app. Also  a bug is literally annoying me. When I launch the app  it freezes  displays contact numbers instead of names and crashes.

Great interface and customisation options. Really very impressed. The only issue is MMS images display really small when they're pressed on. Doesn't match the rest of the UI. Also  when in a message pressing the back button causes the screen to kind of flash  this is a UI bug.

Fast and responsive with adequate customizability. Retains most of UI in Messenger. Mark As Read from notification could be the sole reason for replacing the stock app for this app. Miss the random colours on the chat list  though. The only issue I found was that it did not find messages containing search words  while stock Messenger did. Keep it snappy and error-free but do not weigh down with too many extra features.

Hopefully on you next update  it's something to do with group messaging. Like most messaging apps  when sending a message to multiple people  aside from it showing on each receiver's thread  every message should be found in one thread so I don't need to retype the names of my receivers in every message I wish to send by group. I tried several messaging apps available in Google play store and even the default messaging app of my Sony Xperia C3 failed me in sending group messages for they can't cater long messages that are mostly sent in group  it keeps prompting error messages before a message is successfully sent. And I'm hoping that this messaging app is not like that. With your next update  hopefully you'll have several options for font styles like the choco cooky font style of Samsung phones for that's actually my frustration in my phone (At least I can achieve it through this messaging app). I really love this app that's why I'm making an effort to help in its improvement. Kudos QKSMS team!

It's extremely fast  which I can't say about some other apps (ahem  mysms)  and its completely free with no annoying ads! It also handles the T-Mobile WiFi calling MMS conflict the best out of any app I've seen! The only problem I have with it is when you're in night mode and go to enter a recipient for a new text  the search results are in white text on a white background  so you can't see who you're choosing  womp.

Bugs I've noticed so far is that the app does not actually delete messages  I have another SMS app and I go in all the messages I thought I deleted with QK are still there. Theres NO notification of received MMS when data is disabled. When going back into the app when i have a new sms the sms doesnt show up  its blank. And is there any way to make the send icon a little smaller? I think it would fit in well with the overall look of the app. Also  an option to auto enable data when sending and receiving MMS?

However small bugs really detract from the overall experience. Sometimes SMS and MMS messages from one contact will temporarily appear in another conversation if you quickly switch conversations. Also  entire conversations sometimes temporarily disappear when opening the app through quick reply. It's these small clunky bugs that really hold this app back from being one of the best. Using LG G4

Many of my conversation are lost. at the end when I'm ready to close there is no send icon and when I tap to look for it your app just loses the whole conversation and my time is wasted. this happens way too often. I just had your app delete a whole message while I was trying to find your damneud send icon. there never is a send icon buddy! The second point is a good programmer never deletes anything obviously vital without asking for a confirmation! not asking is just PMS!

A recent update fixed the night mode issues I was having.

But there are a couple big issues for me: 1) Auto night mode is not consistent  and the text does not change to a contrasting color without backing out of or force restarting the app. 2) MMS works well  for receiving messages  but they are displayed as this ludicrously small slide show at the top of the screen. Why can't I look at each image individually and zoom?

Contact avatars are all kinds of buggy with photos of the wrong people getting placed with the wrong threads  group thread avatars are completely uninformative at a glance (Google Messenger does this MUCH better by showing up to 4 participants) and photo messages with text are not viewable - they play like a slideshow. Inability to add multiple photos at once to send and occasional lag are the nails in the coffin. Looks aren't everything - it has to work! Messenger it is  for me; Material Design & bug free.

On my Nexus 6 on Lollipop  I am getting 2 popups when I receive a text.

Not as much customization as others but that's fine...I do appreciate not being overwhelmed with endless options. I just wished one of the features I really use (delayed timer on messages sent) worked properly. From what I understand it has to be enabled before EVERY sent message...and even at that it still doesn't delay anything (even if I set the delay at 30 sec in the settings). It is a totally free/ad free app though...so I will stop complaining... Thks devs!!

Once or twice a day it has to be force stopped and restarted or the phone becomes sluggish. After restarting it the phone is fine for 12 to 20 hours.. installed on a Samsung S5. Fix that issue and I'd give it 5 plus stars.

Instead of the return key I have text smiley faces or frowns. Often text won't send & when it does I get either error code 1 or -1 & often when I send a photo it doesn't send at all.

First off  it needs to give the option to click on a contact name when starting a new message conversation. It is very annoying to have to manually enter a phone number that already exists in your contact list. Secondly  it needs to give the option to attach files not just access the gallery. I prefer personally to attach photos directly from my file manager and it will not allow for this. Other than that it is a very useful application. I love the dark and app and black themes period I am legally blind so having a dark theme is a must. It really helps being able to see it and the adjustable fonts are helpful as well.

There is a desktop version and you can synchronize between mobile and desktop version.

This only requires about 20 mins every morning. The app works very well  I can confirm that. You need to create the cards using the (free open source) computer program  it is not possible to create the cards using the app. Card creation is the initial part of the learning process  and you end up with cards that you have created for your needs. This flexability is one of the great things about anki. Ability to sync cards is great too.

Not a big deal being a useful and free app  but I would recommend to anyone with the same issue just to save time if the sync keeps mumping up. Huge thanks to the Dev Team!

You can waste a lot of time watching tutorials  hoping that they will get around to mentioning the existence of Android or PC or showing the non-Apple/iPhone interfaces (spoiler: they don't). And you can waste a lot of time trying to find the missing features you saw in the tutorials  (spoiler: they are not there). Finally  you can search their manual and supporting documentation for some sort of acknowledgement that these features are missing form the Android/PC versions of the software  so you can allow yourself to stop searching in vain and go to bed  but this search will be fruitless too. So  if you want an intelligent program training you on flashcards using spaced repetition  and you don't mind that you can do only the most nominal of editing of the cards themselves  this one is for you. But don't expect greatness  or supporting materials for non Apple users.

The language I'm learning uses three fairly obscure characters: ®´ ®_ ®ö. These show up fine on the desktop version  but render as blank spaces or a ? on the app. These misrenders then get synced back onto the database. Is there a chance this could get fixed  or should I go ahead and find alternate characters to represent them? 2. One of the advantages of a mobile app flashcard system is that you can easily create audio flashcards in the field. The current app requires five touches to record audio (+  Add  paperclip  record audio  RECORD). It would be great to be able to do this in fewer steps  though I realize that might not be possible without overcrowding the interface.

Unfortunately I will have to go and create a new duplicate deck in reverse. There's a good few hours down the drain. Other than that I can see the benefits of this system but why they didn't include this functionality for learning languages is beyond me.

I wish I could see all of my cards in a deck in a list so I could choose which to look at. I wish I could make decks on my computer and there were a way to synch them on my phone through an account. I wish the push notifications would send when cards are due  and not only when I actually open the app. What use is that? I wish the push notifications didn't resend any time my screen turns off in the middle of studying a deck. I wish there were some pre-made decks for students in popular subjects such as anatomy or psychology or languages. Maybe charge a dollar for access to pre made decks. It would really be worth it  because making flashcards for anatomy consumes way more time than I can afford  really  but I have to do it.

But now my devices happily sync up my custom and shared decks  so I have no complaints- it's fast  convenient  makes learning make sense  and gives you more types of feedback on your studying than any other program.

Simple and useful  but I'd really appreciate the ability to search and review cards at my discretion.

Instead  when I search for the card all I get in the answer is a scramble of code. Fix this and I'd happily pay good money for the app. Cheers!

Being able to review on the go with your phone brilliant. One of the best things about this app is the fact that you have more options than just text. For example  I can take a picture with my phone's camera or get a picture from my phone's gallery and put that on a side of the card. I have been using this tool a lot recently! Great app!

It is extremely flexible and offers countless ways to customize your deck. I personally prefer to create the cards on my desktop and sync with my portable devices. Include pictures and sound with your cards  enable the whiteboard to write your answers  require that the answer be typed in  create cloze cards etc. You can even create multiple cards with one click: forwards/backwards/spelling or use it to have one image with several labeled parts  each part with its own card. If you don't want all of this  you can also just keep your cards simple. I highly recommend watching a tutorial video or reading the manual so that you can make the most of this amazing app.

However  for the first-time user  it does look complicated until you understand the actual framework - i.e. how it was thought to work. A suggestion here - in the help system  change 'cards' for 'templates' where appropriate. Once i got my head around templates and different types  i got myself to design few common types i use most and bang! Adding actual flashcards now using the templates is as simple as it can be .... And i can use cloze-types  images  etc.

Today I am happy to report that AnkiDroid does exactly what I wanted. Adding cards is easy; the review interface is streamlined and practical to use with one thumb; and it does a good job of showing the cards I am struggling with. Synchronization between AnkiDroid (on a phone and a tablet)  the desktop app  and the web site all works smoothly. The navigation in the AnkiDroid UI confused me somewhat when I first starting using it. For example  the back button moves up to a higher level in the app structure  rather than returning you to the previous screen  which is fine but unexpected. Once I got used to the layout it works well.

I'd like to see a one-tap collapse/open feature for groups. Just a slight inconvenience though nothing major. Also  almost every time I use the sync button  a full sync from the server is necessary. I don't understand why as I sync each one before and after using the program (pc program and phone app).

However  it will be great if the developers could include a simple UI for text-editting and even inserting other media files right in the andriod app itself. (Bold  Underline and Italics  etc) I find such functions to be crucial factors for memory retention and it is time-consuming to manually key in the symbols and codes in my phone or to always use the desktop app to quickly highlight points. It will be a perfect app to me if it has these functions added.

If you get it right twice you have to wait a day to review the word again. So I tried saying I got all them wrong so I could review then whenever I wanted. After you get more than one wrong it will just constantly go back to the words you got wrong; preventing you from practicing other. It also goes in the order that they were added. So as I'm reviewing them more and more  because of memory I can see one word and know what the next word will be.

To elaborate  I started off with only ankidroid and was instantly won over by its usefulness. I then decided to make my own deck on the pc version. This is where the program breaks down there is no way to simply add a deck from anki pc to ankidroid without completely overwriting all progress and cards on ankidroid. This is disappointing to say the least.

What makes this one better than the circle one is that YOU CAN ACTUALLY READ the number on the taskbar  as the circle battery app looks ridiculously tiny.

Though it rounds up to the next hour after 30 mins (so when your phone's been unplugged for 1 hr 35 mins  it appears as 2 hrs in the notification bar). It's misleading sometimes so I suggest you adjust the round up to maybe 45 mins onwards? Otherwise  it's a great app.

It tells the exact battery percent so i know when i need to charge it. The really big drawback is that it drains battery. I read online that battery monitor apps have to examine and get information from the battery frequently  thus draining it faster. I'll stay away from it now  for i do not know if there will be long term effects on the battery. It's a very nice and informative app though. :)

Then recently  I noticed my battery percentage was off by no less than 30%. The app showed my battery was draining nearly 10% every minute  doing nothing on it. But if it read 20%  i connect the charger and it reads something like 80%  take off charger  and sinks down to 5% in about a minute. I don't understand it anymore.

The changing nature of Android has broken this app further, and the developers dumped the source code hoping outsiders would develop the program for them, while they reaped the benefits.

There are just a few small changes that would make a WORLD of improvement, IMO, such as allowing more than one widget (there's plenty of space, why limit it?), allowing widgets to be wider (again, the space is there, why the limit?), being able to have widgets without overriding the stock clock, and being able to reposition the clock/widgets and maybe notification icons too. Also, custom apps/shortcut/actions for the corner gestures would be very useful too. No reason to limit those to phone and camera only. :P And lastly, an option to display ongoing notifications (maybe below the higher priority ones) would be nice too."

But, no where is it clear as to how to do this. At least it is not obvious how to do so.

That was until all my decks just disappeared. Now, why would I want to use the application without anything to practice?! Update 2/14/2016 I thought that this was caused by a automatic update to a version that forced a logging into the site to use any features. Or at least all that was prompted for was to login to the site, and the decks showed zero. I had built a few decks. I feel that maybe for an Open Source project still alive, I judged to harshly after my initial shock. I'm still going to have to dig through old storage backups for any possible files. I already deleted the application on the phone. 5/3/2016 I was able to remove the /storage/sdcard0/AnkiDroid/ folder. Install the Application again. Next, I restored the last copy of the folder before the card sets disappeared. Then started the application and the cards all showed-up again. I'm happy that I had the backup and that it was that simple."

It is far too over-complicated. Bear witness. Even trying to explain why it is so terrible will be confusing, and then bear in mind, working with the app is even worse. For example, it totally tries to own when and what I can study. It disappears my cards if it thinks I have studied them enough, forcing me to go and figure out how to put them back into the study session based on how many days to advance my ""review"" session. If I want to set up a custom study session to force it to allow me to study what I want, when I want, again it disappears the original deck - where I can no longer ""browse"" my list of cards, which btw, I have to do whenever I want to see a custom field because the app does not make it easy to add the field to the study deck. If none of this makes sense, then you are in the same boat I am in ‰ÛÒ only hopefully you haven‰Ûªt put time and effort into creating a custom deck with this (cr)app."

I wish the push notifications would send when cards are due, and not only when I actually open the app. What use is that? I wish the push notifications didn't resend any time my screen turns off in the middle of studying a deck. I wish there were some pre-made decks for students in popular subjects such as anatomy or psychology or languages. Maybe charge a dollar for access to pre made decks. It would really be worth it, because making flashcards for anatomy consumes way more time than I can afford, really, but I have to do it."

For free. It has all the bells and whistles I could want save for a tweak here and there (e.g.: perhaps a better way to distinguish which podcasts you've already heard... The grey text is quite close to plain black). All in all, a great app. Highly recommended!"

I can't scroll through an episode. The 30 second forward/back button doesn't work. 2. Jumping to the middle with the scroll bar will work once but it just jumps to a random place that doesn't match the scroll position. It won't respond to any other junior after that. 3. The episode won't stop playing. The pause button won't work. Closing the app won't work. I have to force stop through settings.

But the major change has to be do is that the floating shortcut doesn't appeare as soon as text is been coppied on clipboard and the thing which has to be done is firstly we have to pull down the notification tray and then after putting it back the floating shortcut appeares and also the bubble short cut is insecure while using banking apps so I would rate app as 5 star only when you people will develop an app of such a form that app will not ask acesseblity permission.

However, there isn't much value in the application because a typical ""Notepad"" application pretty much does the same job if you wish for text and other media like a file. It would have been awesome if the contextual clipboard is presented with the option to pick up the values from ""Clip Stack"". For instance, I navigate to a website and would want to paste multiple values in the text fields designated. If I attempt to copy a value from Clip Stack app and then navigate back to the website to paste those values, it would take me a lot of time. Instead of that, WHAT IF soon after I long-press on the field, it presents with the option to paste content from the clipboard as well as present me a snapshot of values from ""Clip Stack"", which way I should have attempted to pick and paste one of the values from the application. This would be more intuitive. Not sure whether Android provides us a way to achieve it. But, such a feature would have truly been awesome instead of the existing features. Application design surely is commendable. But, unless the aforementioned feature has been added, we would not be finding it usable."

This was obvious for acknowledgement after only 5 mins for my part. 2) You offer all functions in the free version  3) You ask for donation, but only to support you, not to unlock extra features, as they are already available in the free version. 4) The application does NOT take a lot of memory = it's a small size.  5) Simply, you have made a very nice looking interface and very easy to access from the drop-down menu at the top of screen. THANK YOU. In my head it yields: ""Make it work, but keep it simple"", which is exactly what you did.  I find these reasons to be VERY high and humble service. Hence I donated the highest possible amount you've made available. Respect for you ""guys"". I will of course rate you on Google play store.  Yasemin Nielsen, Denmark/Norway"

One improvement I'd suggest is better screen management with landscape orientation. It's difficult to use vi or sed to edit scripts with a touch phone keyboard that hogs half the screen space. I don't think the screen can be scrolled but maybe I didn't figure out how. Public key management works well. THANKS !

Only used it for a couple of hours, so don't know if there are other issues, but the biggest improvement for me would be supporting double-tap, when the widget is expanded to the full home screen. Double tap turns the screen on/off on LG G3, and it's one of my favorite Android features. To make it work, I need to leave some free area on the screen, but this means, I cannot display everything I want in the wizard. Would be lot more user-friendly, if the widget just passed the double-tap signal to the OS."

Financius was the best expense manager that I had seen during the time I was using it. Once I encountered another app called Expense Manager, it became a tossup on which one was better. Financius offers a better UI and reporting, while Expense Manager offers decent reporting with meh UI, but most importantly I think, Expense Manager has widgets to quick-add expenses, while Financius does not. To put that in perspective, using Expense Manager, i have my 8 most used categories on a homescreen, tap one it brings up a expense entry screen, selecting the category. I enter an amount and hit submit. Financius requires me to start the app, hit new transaction, enter an amount, select category, select tags (if applicable) and then submit. So I prefer Financius for the reporting and UI, but Expense Manager for the functionality. If Financius were to add widgets, it would reign supreme for me again."

Why?!! I have selected food show the tags relevant!! Why do I need to select account if I have only one?!? Searching for an alternative will uninstall asap.

I had a old Samsung Infuse and the application worked great. I had 3000+ pictures and they rotated between the 7 screens. A different picture on each screen. I had that phone for almost 3 years. This year I treated myself for Christmas and bought the Samsung Galaxy Note 4. I am so disappointed because I cannot get the application to switch pictures when I change screens. I read in your report that this seems to be a problem with the Galaxy S series. FIX IT!

Before it had always shown: picture unavailable etc. How I made this work: I'm running the note 4 with nova launcher. I use 3 home screens. Therefore I created 3 folders i file manager and put the wallpapers I wanted to use in them. Open live wallpaper then select MP live. Create your screen settings pages (home screen pages). Remember, picture source= picture folder. Use the folders you created for that particular screen. I also used the honeycomb tablet workaround option. Hope this helps."

I installed this on HTC One M8 and use it to alternate my home screen wallpaper every ten seconds (which can be set to a shorter or longer interval based on preference). It is not possible, though, to set a separate image for each home screen on the M8, even when using specialised settings in the app. This is not a feature that I wanted to use, but I mention it so other M8 owners are aware that HTC Sense prevents access to this.

It also will not let you set the position for wallpapers larger than your display, and there isn't a setting to enable the ""moving background"" that is standard on Android for normal wallpapers. Many of the transitions do not work; many of them occurred even when moving between different pages of my home screen that had the same settings. Crossfade didn't work when unlocking my phone. The wallpaper faded to black and then faded the new wallpaper in. This would probably be acceptable if the animation was in any way smooth. In summary, this app has some neat features that ""work,"" but some of them don't work and the ones that do never seem to work well. Didn't use it long enough to see if it impacts battery life.

I've been using this app for over 2 years on Samsung and Motorola devices with absolutely no problems. Just remember to configure Your launcher (I use Nova Prime) to Muzei so all you have to do is double tap your screen to change images or adjust your settings. This app allows lots of customization options. Muzei also has endless extensions so you will never be bored with the same old photos again. I've experienced no major battery drain and no bugs. Highly recommended!

I had to load the app twice before it pulled another one (edit: then 5 mins later it reverted to the first wallpaper).

I'm an avid gamer who likes a challenge now and again, but this game is challenging on an aggravating level. Health loss is common and unavoidable, scarce healing resources, hunger/ starvation comes on too quickly, scarce food resources, potions and scrolls are a crap-shoot so there is no way to strategize their use, and also permadeath.

I played about 200 games before I figured most of it out. After 550 games I have finally beat the game with all 4 classes and made it back out to the top with the warrior. Great sound effects and music. A typical game can last you anywhere from 1 minute to an hour. A great quick diversion that can hold your attention for a long time. I only have 4 more badges to get! You won't regret getting this game. The best part? NO ADS!

Still haven't beaten it yet but I play it constantly. One thing I might recommend though is rebalancing he hunger and food, either make satiety points decrease slower, increase the potency of food and the satiety point cap, or increase the frequency of food drops. Starvation has been the thing that killed me the most, and I'm very sparing with any food I get only eating when starving. Would be 5 stars if not for the hunger!"

Other than that, pixel dungeon is a fun game definitely worth trying out."

I have beaten it with the Warrior, the Mage, and the Rogue. Working on the Huntress currently. Yes, the game is hard but once you have a good strategy you will have farther runs each time. Wait until you are starving to eat your rations and your health is low, or medium if you're not that brave. Stretching your rations is a must. If you have no ration and say 5 hp potions use hp potions until you find food trust me you will find it. Identify potions and scrolls early on as its important to know what you have. Use all potions that are unidentified at the end of a level, and all scrolls that are unidentified at the beginning of the next lvl. Different strategies work for different classes so make adjustments to how you play just like any rpg. Please download this game and don't give up! You will get past the Goo I promise. Stand in water while fighting to wash away his caustic ooze and use an earth root for added protection. Good luck!!"

I wish it were a bit more complex, like Nethack or even ToME or Cataclysm, but nobody seems to have successfully adapted those to an ergonomic mobile interface, so Pixel Dungeon is always my number one choice if I've got some time to kill (and even if I don't, haha). Definitely a game I am proud to play and evangelize about."

But I believe a normal person, like me, doesn't really have the time on everyday basis to watch all the shows that air in a day, hence we binge watch the entire season when it's over... And I think that's something you should take into consideration... If a show is marked as binge watch.. Then it should not be listed in the recent/upcoming list.. And should give a notification when the current season is over. Add that and it will be a 5 star review :)"

You need to figure out something for when you call someone and they are talking to somebody else on signal and it just says Busy & end of story. Maybe have signal alert my phone when the previous busy signal is now an open line. But that's just my suggestion. I'm sure there is a better idea out there for this issue but either way fix that problem & a lot of us that use your app daily will be very happy and ultimately less stressed out from this issue.

This is the ideal messaging application for secure encryption merged with SMS/MMS. No more switching between 2 messengers! Material design is nice. My only suggestions would be to eliminate the lock icon from each line of encrypted text and just keep a lock icon in the top next to the name and the addition of stickers like telegram.

It's come in handy for running simple commands but where it really shines, at least for me, are the key shortcuts and ability to set commands to execute immediately the terminal is started. I set ""su"" then ""pkill mediaserver"" since it quickly frees the mediaserver when trying to catch a moment on photo but camera can't because something else is engaging the server. It's all done so fast since I keep its icon in my notification bar (along a few others)."

It's a larger issue for those symbols though. You can't get symbols by caps lock so I am prevented from using my keyboard for symbols entirely, so I can't take quick notes in computer science lecture. That could use fixing, especially since some symbols like $ is not possible from the bottom menu."

I'd be willing to pay to support the developer. I've been searching for such an amazing app for a very long time. Before I used to download the pictures from Google but I have had problems with adjusting the resolution to my phone. The wallpaper doesn't fit my phone at all, it even gives me a blur quality of that picture. But now, thank god, this app is existed. The quality of the picture is top-notch. The resolution fits perfectly to my screen ratio. Thank you very much for such an amazing app. I can't stop myself from staring at my phone screen right now. :-)"

I have had a tweet reply from the developer, but it was not very helpful. This apps looks great, but as yet, I have been unable to connect to any chat servers! Which, kind of defeats the object of having the app. I am a syadmin for a chat server and if I cannot get my app connected to my own server, then something is very wrong. I have triple checked the settings, watched the ejabberd server logs, but this app just refuses to connect - probably something to do with the server certificate, but I have tried all combinations of the app security options and still no joy. So, I am happy to accept any help or suggestions up until Wednesday 26th August, then the app gets uninstalled. Now, that's very reasonable in my book. What does the developer think? :-)"

The moment i start to type a new message the letter i typed appears twice and in between the two is the last word from the previous message. It happens when there are two concecutive messages from me. Also if on a blank row i just start erasing the last word appeares and starts gettig erased. LG G3. Please fix

The features this application has are actually too numerous to list here however I would advise anyone to try it for themselves and see. Personally I'm just happy the app has the option to automatically rotate my wallpaper every couple of hours minutes or even days. And surprisingly it doesn't seem to be a battery hog

If you like roguelikes then this game is a must-have for you. There are a ton of interlocking mechanics that make this game very unique. As the description states, this game is very difficult and luck-based. I have never won a single run yet although I've played over 100 games; I barely made it to the final boss once on my best run. To succeed in Pixel Dungeon you'll need a decent understanding of the game's mechanics, good resource management, and luck. All in all, this game is amazing! Can only recommend!"

One wrong turn in this deadly dungeon, you'll find yourself back at square one, all knowledge of potion effects lost: meaning you have to try them and probably set yourself on fire. It's a vicious cycle. That been said, the mechanics are superb for a mobile platform. ""Just one more try"" is something you'll probably be muttering a lot. Download PD and get ready to hate yourself, in a... good way?"

But when I do.. it's a game that I spent time playing and I still want more. Has no ads and is enjoyable and challenging. Doesn't make you feel like you have to play it all the time but it comes on your mind when you have some downtime - I could solve a puzzle or two! Definitely recommended.

Another thing, a couple of commands that ARE in other Linux computers like Debian are missing like nano from Android.
