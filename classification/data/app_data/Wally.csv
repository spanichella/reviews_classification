I'd be willing to pay to support the developer. I've been searching for such an amazing app for a very long time. Before I used to download the pictures from Google but I have had problems with adjusting the resolution to my phone. The wallpaper doesn't fit my phone at all, it even gives me a blur quality of that picture. But now, thank god, this app is existed. The quality of the picture is top-notch. The resolution fits perfectly to my screen ratio. Thank you very much for such an amazing app. I can't stop myself from staring at my phone screen right now. :-)"
