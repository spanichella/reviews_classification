But I believe a normal person, like me, doesn't really have the time on everyday basis to watch all the shows that air in a day, hence we binge watch the entire season when it's over... And I think that's something you should take into consideration... If a show is marked as binge watch.. Then it should not be listed in the recent/upcoming list.. And should give a notification when the current season is over. Add that and it will be a 5 star review :)"
