When i google it  i get told to call a 1-800 number. I refuse to call an american number (not in the US) just to get a lock screen app to work. It seems the app won't overwrite touchwiz lockscreen on my older android device (android 4.3)

Also  doesn't seem to wake very well after movement over the proximity sensor  and doesn't seem to have any settings to adjust the sensitivity  like I've seen similar apps do  defeating the purpose of this app.

I've been using this app on every phone I have gotten s3 mini z1 and z3+  and it has never failed and appreciate the developer keeping it ad free and no pro version with more features. I just wish there's an option to pick a wallpaper picture instead of just choosing a solid colour or the home screen wallpaper.

If you want to use the AcDisplay lock screen and a pin  you simply enable AcDisplay on top of your stock lock screen. However  when opening camera from an off display using volume button shortcuts  AcDisplay will be in your way. Also  when using the AcDisplay camera shortcut  you will have to enter your pin before being able to use the camera (versus being able to use camera from the lock screen with the stock lock screen). 2. PHONES WITH FINGER SCANNERS MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY. Many phones such as the Honor 5x  Honor 8  Nexus 5x  and Nexus 6p have a fingerprint scanner that allows you to go from an off display directly to the home screen when your finger is scanned. You cannot do this with AcDisplay  as the AcDisplay lock screen will open up every time your phone is unlocked.

I've searched for some app to show small and compact notifications after upgrade from Kitkat 4.4.4 to Lollipop 5.0.2 on my Sony Xperia Z3 compact. Despite this beauty works smooth  it only makes things worse: to unlock a mobile I need to make FOUR actions: press power button  swipe AcDisplay screen  swipe my unlock pattern. This is just ridiculous!

I have this setup in 3 of my devices! All look stunning! A hat tip to you my friend! SUGGESTIONS: Allow the widget to be centered on the lock screen  currently it's kind of 70% vertical.

I also want to see an update for fingerprint recognition to unlock the lockscreen because it defeats the purpose of having two lockscreens active to enter homescreen.

I have two suggestions that would make this a five star app IMO: It would be nice if I can adjust the delay when Active mode shows AC Display relative to me triggering the proximity sensor. Right now  it is about four seconds but I really want to be able to wave my hand over my phone. Second  I would like to have my phone behave as a clock full time when it is plugged in  and keep AC Display on.

There are 2 other options as well  making this app serve as a lock screen and/or turn on the screen based on device sensors. The overall design is very much minimalistic with a great looking design  and there are also plenty of settings to customize to fit your liking. AcDisplay is great for those wanting to view notifications quickly with a minimal and usable design.

There are just a few small changes that would make a WORLD of improvement  IMO  such as allowing more than one widget (there's plenty of space  why limit it?)  allowing widgets to be wider (again  the space is there  why the limit?)  being able to have widgets without overriding the stock clock  and being able to reposition the clock/widgets and maybe notification icons too. Also  custom apps/shortcut/actions for the corner gestures would be very useful too. No reason to limit those to phone and camera only. :P And lastly  an option to display ongoing notifications (maybe below the higher priority ones) would be nice too.

About 1 month ago  mostly right after unlocking the screen and sometimes randomly  the display tilts/shifts with an absurd angle and goes grayscale and then shortly after phone freezes  makes me do a hard reset. I thought it was a phone problem because I hadn't installed a new app. But then I thought maybe it's about this app  because it happened mostly after unlocking. So i disabled it and the problem solved. Hope this gets fixed. Cheers

Only complaints are with lollipop's new lock screen (wish it could go straight to pattern lock rather than slide) The design is elegant and a beautiful way of showing notifications  much cleaner than the lollipop notifications. There is one thing I'd love to have implemented: music control. Would it be possible for you to choose to play/pause/fwd/back depending on what controls are in the notification? Edit: holy crap thank you!! He listened! Edit: Podcast addict does not seem to have playback control. not sure if this is a fix on the display side.

Is there a way to hide it on AcDisplay? Also it provides a bit of insecurity as anyone could just wake my phone and see incoming messeges (I use the lockscreen option)| Second: Why should your app take too much ram so it surely uses the CPU in the background taking up battery.. or am I wrong?

Looks so much better than the stock lockscreen. I've noticed a couple of bugs:the swipe animation freezes sometimes  and the clock has a lag in updating the time when the screen turns on. The only thing I didn't like was how I could only add one widget  and that when I did  it covered the clock. Other than that - great!

You can't set custom shortcuts for unlock areas that aren't just dialer/camera (what about SMS? or a custom activity?). It doesn't seem to block the home button if you have your system lock screen disabled. If you *don't* disable your system lock screen  it takes about 5 seconds for AC display to appear when you wake up your phone. It doesn't report widget size to widgets  so many can't work properly.

This is just waking up by proximity sensor like puting out from pocket. Pls add that and it will be perfect. Or does it do already and I just miss it?

It would be great to use the finger sensor with the AcDisplay and bypass the default lockscreen altogether from Active Mode. Visually  AcDisplay is a beauty and has some really nice functionality  however performance is unstable and the integration with the OS is not great.

I just wish there was the ability to leave the screen on longer (until I dismiss  1 hour  etc)  maybe contact photos for notifications  proximity sensors  and shortcuts on lock screen. Also  it seems to not play well with Textra. When I get a text message  it will flash the screen on  then turn off and on until I open the notification. I have tried changing the priorities and all other options.

Touch the icon and you can preview the notification. It works with every app I receive notifications on. (Facebook, my texting app, WhatsApp) I love that I can pull my phone out of my Otterbox and the screen wakes up. Also, it'll wake the screen up if I lift my phone off of the table. The sweetest feature to AC Display is the widget integration. I like customizing my phone and being I can use KWGT to make a custom lockscreen it solves my custom needs."

This is ideal if you're looking to keep your phone looking light and modern. Kudos to the devs. Edit : Hope the devs will address this problem. As of late the Lock screen doesn't turn off if I get a notification. I've set it to turn off five seconds after I get a notification but it doesn't. It will show the display and time without switching off which can be quite annoying when youre in bed and get a notification that makes the display light up all night.
