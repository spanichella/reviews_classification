Imo the one HUGE thing this application is missing imo RIGHT NOW in its CURRENT version, is the ability to sync its data with an online source of our choosing, ie google, onedrive, Dropbox, etc. Add this feature, and I will PERSONALLY donate to the continued development of this thing, even being in debt. I already am very much wanting to, but cannot make myself do so without that one."

But the major change has to be do is that the floating shortcut doesn't appeare as soon as text is been coppied on clipboard and the thing which has to be done is firstly we have to pull down the notification tray and then after putting it back the floating shortcut appeares and also the bubble short cut is insecure while using banking apps so I would rate app as 5 star only when you people will develop an app of such a form that app will not ask acesseblity permission.

However, there isn't much value in the application because a typical ""Notepad"" application pretty much does the same job if you wish for text and other media like a file. It would have been awesome if the contextual clipboard is presented with the option to pick up the values from ""Clip Stack"". For instance, I navigate to a website and would want to paste multiple values in the text fields designated. If I attempt to copy a value from Clip Stack app and then navigate back to the website to paste those values, it would take me a lot of time. Instead of that, WHAT IF soon after I long-press on the field, it presents with the option to paste content from the clipboard as well as present me a snapshot of values from ""Clip Stack"", which way I should have attempted to pick and paste one of the values from the application. This would be more intuitive. Not sure whether Android provides us a way to achieve it. But, such a feature would have truly been awesome instead of the existing features. Application design surely is commendable. But, unless the aforementioned feature has been added, we would not be finding it usable."

This was obvious for acknowledgement after only 5 mins for my part. 2) You offer all functions in the free version  3) You ask for donation, but only to support you, not to unlock extra features, as they are already available in the free version. 4) The application does NOT take a lot of memory = it's a small size.  5) Simply, you have made a very nice looking interface and very easy to access from the drop-down menu at the top of screen. THANK YOU. In my head it yields: ""Make it work, but keep it simple"", which is exactly what you did.  I find these reasons to be VERY high and humble service. Hence I donated the highest possible amount you've made available. Respect for you ""guys"". I will of course rate you on Google play store.  Yasemin Nielsen, Denmark/Norway"

I wish the developer would not ask Accessibility permission for the floating bubble. WARNING: this gives the app access to any window's content! Imagine the horror if you have a banking app opened!! I would disable the feature until the developer changes the implementation to a non-intrusive one. For now, back to using the safe and secure Clipper app."
