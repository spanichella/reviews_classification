EDIT: Found out command that keeps process dead (tested in terminal as root, and it works). Instead of calling ""kill [pid]"", call: ""am force-stop [package name]"" Can the developer please add this command as a second button, such as ""force-stop package""? It would make it a lot more powerful as a task killer."
