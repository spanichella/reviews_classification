I had a old Samsung Infuse and the application worked great. I had 3000+ pictures and they rotated between the 7 screens. A different picture on each screen. I had that phone for almost 3 years. This year I treated myself for Christmas and bought the Samsung Galaxy Note 4. I am so disappointed because I cannot get the application to switch pictures when I change screens. I read in your report that this seems to be a problem with the Galaxy S series. FIX IT!

It also will not let you set the position for wallpapers larger than your display, and there isn't a setting to enable the ""moving background"" that is standard on Android for normal wallpapers. Many of the transitions do not work; many of them occurred even when moving between different pages of my home screen that had the same settings. Crossfade didn't work when unlocking my phone. The wallpaper faded to black and then faded the new wallpaper in. This would probably be acceptable if the animation was in any way smooth. In summary, this app has some neat features that ""work,"" but some of them don't work and the ones that do never seem to work well. Didn't use it long enough to see if it impacts battery life.

My only suggestion would be to have an option to combine all screens into a single wallpaper like the standard wallpaper only you get the interval change. It's a minor suggestion and should not take away form the app."

I have the transition interval set to Never and set images to change on double tap but backgrounds still change at random intervals. Ofttimes when I double tap to change backgrounds it takes over a minute to complete the operation. It shouldn't take so long to select a few random images on a quadcore phone. The app hasn't been updated since 2013. I think it's due time for a compatibility update.
