You need to figure out something for when you call someone and they are talking to somebody else on signal and it just says Busy & end of story. Maybe have signal alert my phone when the previous busy signal is now an open line. But that's just my suggestion. I'm sure there is a better idea out there for this issue but either way fix that problem & a lot of us that use your app daily will be very happy and ultimately less stressed out from this issue. Thanks you. Poe

This is the ideal messaging application for secure encryption merged with SMS/MMS. No more switching between 2 messengers! Material design is nice. My only suggestions would be to eliminate the lock icon from each line of encrypted text and just keep a lock icon in the top next to the name and the addition of stickers like telegram. I'm sure it will only get better with each update. Keep up the good work!

Any time people involved me in a group text or I try to initiate one, I get errors. The extra frustrating thing is that this has been a known bug for a while, yet it hasn't been fixed. I've missed out on conversations, and, since they're listed in Signal without being able to download them, I have no way of viewing them at all."

I really love this app. Ok here's the story : i recently change my SIM card and phone number then when im using Signal (sms or call) it's my old phone number appearing...... The receiver can call me back or sms back at my old number.... That's weird.... Probably if I uninstall/re-install the app it could be fixed but i haven't try yet. I changed my phone number and i don't want anybody knowing my new one. So on this side i kinda like that """"""""glitch"""""""" or bug."

Impossible to just add someone to a message... You have to go through a completely different set of steps to text more than one person. Why do you have to name the group when there is no way to see and select named groups later? Tapping the names at the top of the group thread ONLY SHOWS INFORMATION FOR THE FIRST GROUP MEMBER. No ability to compose first, then add recipients: you MUST enter all recipients before composing your message. This is a bug"
