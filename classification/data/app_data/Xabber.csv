I have had a tweet reply from the developer, but it was not very helpful. This apps looks great, but as yet, I have been unable to connect to any chat servers! Which, kind of defeats the object of having the app. I am a syadmin for a chat server and if I cannot get my app connected to my own server, then something is very wrong. I have triple checked the settings, watched the ejabberd server logs, but this app just refuses to connect - probably something to do with the server certificate, but I have tried all combinations of the app security options and still no joy. So, I am happy to accept any help or suggestions up until Wednesday 26th August, then the app gets uninstalled. Now, that's very reasonable in my book. What does the developer think? :-)"
