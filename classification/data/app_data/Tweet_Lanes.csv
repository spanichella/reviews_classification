This is something I find really useful on Tweetcaster, which I'm not using atm because their link system is messed up after their latest update. If they fix it I'll probably go back but it would only be for these two features."

It's a bit slow to load tweets however once it has it does load a lot more than other Twitter apps. Also only loads a certain number of tweets and then I have to wait for a while before I can load the rest. If these could be sorted I would rate it a 5.
