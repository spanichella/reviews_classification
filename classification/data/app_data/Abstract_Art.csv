It says I installed this app but unlike every other app I downloaded it won't create the shortcut to let me use the backgrounds at all. It doesn't even acknowledge that this app even exists on my phone even after downloading. It may be my phone but I never had this problem before or after this app. I would love to use these backgrounds because earthbound was a cool game and I loved the backgrounds.
