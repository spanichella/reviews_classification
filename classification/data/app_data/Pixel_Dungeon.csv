Great gameplay  lots of different scenarios  no dungeon is ever the same! Great graphics! All you rogue-like fans  this game is a must have! Keep up the good work on this excellent game! *Edit* I did find a bug with the shop. When I made it to the shop It was much smaller than usual  and without a shopkeeper. Due to lack of a shopkeeper  I was able to pick up everything  free of charge. I'm guessing this wasn't meant to happen.

There are no ads  no in app purchases  and no shady permissions. I'm amazed that the developer has not tried to make money on this. The developer even releases new content for FREE. If the developer makes another paid game in future they have my purchase.

This is one of the few completely free games (no ads!) that are both professional and enjoyable.

Also you should only be given 1 free food per five levels to make it more challenging. And item durability is terrible please remove it. BTW did you give up watabou? You haven't updated since December.

Cool soundtrack and pixel art as well. You'll see some negative reviews complaining about item durability: they miss the point. The game is about resource management  so a powerful magic item will degrade more quickly. This brings balance to the game. By the way  I thought there was a bug causing keys not to generate. No spoilers  but it's a puzzle  not a bug ;-]

Pixel dungeon is a very well made dungeon crawler game. And don't even get me started on the difficulty. Getting through 25 floors without dying once? Piece of cake!

I've easily spent 30+ hours of my life playing so far and still haven't beaten it! But I still come back since its actually fun  brutal and (mostly) fair. Luck sometimes play a major part however  but thats only because of the nature of random generation and rougelike games. Other than that  its a great game which other free games on the app store should strive to be like.

I've read forums and reddits that state the importance of a 'lucky start' and for me that's not good enough. Combat is often draining as you continually miss  items drop too infrequently and overall  after 30 failed starts I just realised I wasn't having fun.

This game requires strategy and your brain power on solving puzzles and secrets. No no  I'm not going to tell anyone any secrets  this isn't what I'm writing for  I'm writing this because I'm thanking the developers for creating this game! Definitely a 10/5 star app! These are the type of games I am looking for  if I could donate a minimum of one million dollars I probably would! Oh and the main menu music is really nice!

After a couple of years of on-and-off play of this game  I finally managed to complete it; appropriately with a sliver of health remaining. It's frustrating  compelling  surprising and most importantly fun - like all Roguelikes it seems gruelling at the best of times and impossible at worst. Donated after I realised I was having a great time - worth every dollar  and then some. Cheers  Watabou.

If you encounter a wraith  all you see is 'wraith evaded you!' when you try and hit it. The game is beatifull and mystical  but as soon as you find something cool  like an enchanted battleaxe  potion ect  don't expect to have it for long. But the game is free  and the only purchase is a donation  unlike most apps that pressure you into buying powerups  ect with money.

For such a small game (especially on a phone where I don't expect actual fun most of the time)  I find myself playing a lot of this. -The only problem I have found so far is the food mechanic. It seems arbitrary as to how much it fills you up  but it never lasts very long. I always seem to be starving by mid level 2-3 of each run.

It is so hard to find a good dung/mob/slash and hack game out there. This is a game for true strategist's and expert dungeon delvers. I say bravo. I have yet to beat it personally but I've been to floor 18 with all three classes before I met my demise. Bravo on this game guys! Keep them coming!! Just saying there should be a save option though.

This is one tough roguelike game. Under the primitive veneer is a sophisticated Dungeon crawler. Seems to have randomized levels as each time I die (and you will die in this game) and start over  the levels are different. Possibly the best free game on Google play. It runs solid on my Android 4.4.1 running tablet too. No problems with it so far.

The interface is intuitive and nonobtrusive. The gameplay is what you would expect from a rogue like; a challenging experience with variety and replayability. Some people may find the permadeath concept frustrating at first  but i think it works really well  especially on a mobile game. I think it the characters feel a little too similar in playstyle  but otherwise this game is very complete  rather bug free  and a very good game overall.

No stupid in app purchases (it doesn't have them  Play Store said so because you can make a completely optional donation) no ridiculous waiting times  no ads  no pay walls. And the game is really great and not repetitive because of random generation. It's quite difficult but challenging and rewarding  so If you haven't already got it download it now! Please don't rate it bad for permadeath. It's a roguelike.

The interface is perfect  the graphics are great to look at  and (most importantly) the gameplay is unmatched by any other mobile game  free or paid.

It's suprisingly in-depth  ad free  strategic  and addicting in the best way possible. Even the underlying story is really good! The game as a whole brings about a feeling of nostalgia echoing from memories of plundering dungeons in the original legend of zelda. Really difficult until you figure out that you don't mess with giant piranhas EVER. My only regret is finding this game the week before finals. This game has made me question my decision to prioritize college over anything else. 10/10

Great game if you want to have some fun in spare time and don't want to give up much memory. No story  just go and explore. As dungeon is randomly generated  it has great replay value - everytime  it's a new dungeon to explore. But  this game is not for those looking for a story based progressive rpg. You will die many times and then you have to start again from lvl 1. Its really hard (nearly impossible) to complete it for many of us. Well  this is the main feature of rogue like games  so no blame..

At first Pixel Dungeon looks like a more modern version of dungeon cralwers of the past  but it suffers just like a large amount of them did from random combat  unintuitive game mechanics(potion making comes to mind)  and lots of instant death frustration. There's little thrill in finding new items since even equipping unidentified equipment still leaves it unidentified! Also there isn't a hungry meter I can see? Pixel Dungeon exibits some of the least fun dungeon cralwing mechanics in recent memory.

Run into a wraith level 2? Goodbye. All they ask is donations  no IAP that I've seen. Can be frustrating  but if you don't want to be frustrated  find a different genre. It's a little hard to pickup  could use a tutorial.

A app with a steep learning curve and difficulty that rewards veterans of the game (which isn't me of course; maybe soon-to-be veteran) Either way awesome game! I don't see apps like this and maybe when I have a stabilized budget I'll donate as for now this is all I can do for the dev

Either not finding healing items or not knowing if your randomized potion/scroll will help or hurt. Moving to combat is clunky and often gives the ai a free swing. Fun but too much luck involved.

Move the 'no' away from creatures or set a delay please. I enjoy this game  I don't enjoy dying after ninety minutes in a good game. Ideas for additions: Add a 'throb entire screen red when hp is low (and maybe players can set the percent)'  space the buttons so the game can be played on devices with small screens without searching when trying to rest for one enemy's step  fix auto-pathing (it currently paths based on enemies that are not visible and steps back and forth when no path is available)  bugfix the autopathing arrow after a fight (frequently only advances one step or disappears without other actions)  fix the wand of reach (does not switch with enemies as the description states) and a few other things. Keep up the good work on adding things just don't forget the main priority is to have it function well. I am a person who likes to donate yet I do not appreciate improvements when known problems exist  it just compounds the issue and it is the reason software such as Windows exists with great feature bloat and so many bugs the average user is always upset about something.

But just one small complaint I've been playing Pixel Dungeon give or take about 4 years  and I loved it from the beginning. There was a point where I had a hard time keeping up with the game because of all of the updates that was over a year ago so I'm going to try it again. It has been a source of inspiration in my D&D play  and it has never ceased to keep me entertained  no matter how hard or easy I may find it. I especially enjoy a game that is well built  evenly balanced  and takes up less than 30 megabytes of information as if to say; I've been thinking about your Hardware  and I appreciate your patronage. The only time I've had a problem with this game glitching up was due to my own Hardware  completely irrelevant to this game. Except for every so often  I'll touch one part of the screen and my character will want to go the long way  or something out of the way of where I was attempting to go. I don't know if that's a hardware or software problem  but I've encountered it on multiple devices. Regardless this game is fun to play in my opinion. And for those of you with Android consider yourself lucky because you have to pay for it on Steam Powered and iOS all things considered I still think it's worth it!

There should also be a shield  helmet  boots  gauntlets  and greaves added to the game so your character is better defended. A small shop should exist on levels 1-4. Rations for starvation level are not commonly found. Starvation feature should be taken out because its very annoying. Rations should have the ability to provide healing for 5-7 seconds Hidden doors should be easier to find. I'm glad I uninstalled this festering garbage of a videogame. :)

I'm an avid gamer who likes a challenge now and again, but this game is challenging on an aggravating level. Health loss is common and unavoidable, scarce healing resources, hunger/ starvation comes on too quickly, scarce food resources, potions and scrolls are a crap-shoot so there is no way to strategize their use, and also permadeath. This game is kind of set up for you to lose. I enjoyed the other aspects though."

I played about 200 games before I figured most of it out. After 550 games I have finally beat the game with all 4 classes and made it back out to the top with the warrior. Great sound effects and music. A typical game can last you anywhere from 1 minute to an hour. A great quick diversion that can hold your attention for a long time. I only have 4 more badges to get! You won't regret getting this game. The best part? NO ADS!

For such a small game (especially on a phone where I don't expect actual fun most of the time), I find myself playing a lot of this. -The only problem I have found so far is the food mechanic.

Still haven't beaten it yet but I play it constantly. One thing I might recommend though is rebalancing he hunger and food, either make satiety points decrease slower, increase the potency of food and the satiety point cap, or increase the frequency of food drops. Starvation has been the thing that killed me the most, and I'm very sparing with any food I get only eating when starving. Would be 5 stars if not for the hunger!"

Other than that, pixel dungeon is a fun game definitely worth trying out."

I have beaten it with the Warrior, the Mage, and the Rogue. Working on the Huntress currently. Yes, the game is hard but once you have a good strategy you will have farther runs each time. Wait until you are starving to eat your rations and your health is low, or medium if you're not that brave. Stretching your rations is a must. If you have no ration and say 5 hp potions use hp potions until you find food trust me you will find it. Identify potions and scrolls early on as its important to know what you have. Use all potions that are unidentified at the end of a level, and all scrolls that are unidentified at the beginning of the next lvl. Different strategies work for different classes so make adjustments to how you play just like any rpg. Please download this game and don't give up! You will get past the Goo I promise. Stand in water while fighting to wash away his caustic ooze and use an earth root for added protection. Good luck!!"

I consistently die on levels 1, 2, or three. Wraith and piranha are too strong, food is scarce and starvation kills quickly, and so forth.

There were so many bugs that were not exist in older versions, such as : keys don't generate, killing the first boss made you have achievements such as Amulet of Yendor obtained, last boss killed, and unlocking challenges and huntress.

Random dungeon generation makes repeat plays fresh and is very repayable. Bad: The randomness of weapon/armor drops make it difficult to get past some of the early stages, especially if the ghost side quest provides minimal value.
