Those entries contain vital info to find caches sometimes and I hate that I have to leave the app to find them. Something else that would be nice is the ability to upload .gpx trails onto the maps. Already the best geocaching app, but change add that stuff and it's 5 stars for sure."

It has gotten more and more stable over the years - I have been using it since I got my first Android phone back in 2010 - and it is almost perfect: Off-line cache lists and off-line maps are especially useful, they save a lot of data. There are still some minor glitches, but mostly it is stable. Furthermore it is a free, and nowadays it is open source, so whenever Groundspeaks decides to modify their web pages it only takes a few hours until someone fixes the things that were broken by them."

I recommend this app to everyone with an android who asks me about geocaching. One feature that I didn't realize was available right away is the satellite imagery overlay from the 'map selections'... I do a lot of urban geocaching and this is a HUGE help for me since my GPS signal bounces all over the place.
