It started because the vibration intensity on my N6 was way too high, so I found this app. I saw the features for CPU, etc mgmt and looked for another app that maybe had better/expanded features but nope, this one is the BEST!! The simplicity, ease of use and options make this hands down my favorite. It reapplies my CPU & other settings on boot but doesn't keep my vibration intensity set for some reason (I think that's my ROM/kernel because it's worked in the past). 5/5 LOVE IT!!!"

I'm fairly new to this kernel editing and device changing. I always knew how to root and flash ROMs/recoveries/bootloaders. What I didn't realize was the capabilities, and added bonuses of modifying your internal hardware. The biggest advantage for me is CPU, it definitely improved my battery by lowering the frequencies and setting an interactive governor. Anyways, there seems to be one disadvantage at this time. After every reboot (with bootup restoration enabled) all of my customizations reset."

Applying please wait, the message never goes away *update* the issue was fixed very soon after my review, I found one final issue, I'm not sure if it's my device but I can't seem to lock in GPU and CPU frequencies, when I open the app again the frequencies always revert to stock, it would be nice to rid of my other CPU clocking app since Device Control [root] has all in one*"

Thank you Alexander Martinz for not only replying to my review in a civil manner, but most importantly, fixing the app."
