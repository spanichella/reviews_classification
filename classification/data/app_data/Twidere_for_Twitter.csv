My only complaint is the video player kinda lame , you can't seek forward or backward .. You have to watch the whole video again if you want to re watch a specific part of it ..other than that it's good !"

I was pretty excited about being able to customize this app. I uninstalled and reinstalled only to get the same prompt saying the api limit was reached and to try again in an hour.

Every time I scroll down my timeline, media that were previously loaded will load again. This reduces performance and makes scrolling janky. App is way less fluid than other clients.

I don't get notifications of any of my mentions and only got to realize this when using the Web version of Twitter. Even after reinstalling and going over settings extensively. Otherwise would have been a great app.
