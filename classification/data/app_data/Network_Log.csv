Let's you see what your firewall is not blocking. I would add a feature to consolidate entries to and from the same IP address. The log files are too cumbersome.even a five minute log takes for ever to scroll through.

I think the same app with the same UI can be done using the internal VPN tunnel technique. 2) adding possibility of reading the contents of the packets. 3) decryption of the packet using SSL certificates. However, this app is the best so far in showing data flow of traffic and per packet analysis."

After diagnosing the problem I was able to download a firewall and block the data-hungry processes when on data. Thanks developer! It's amazing that this app is for free! :)"
