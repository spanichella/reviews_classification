This is the one game app I put on every single device I own. Awesome app. These puzzles are loads of fun - like the author put it, they work great as little ""toys"" to help pass the time. Having them on my phone is even better! Touch interface works really well, although larger puzzles are easier to control with a tablet even though there's pinch zoom. Definitely recommended."

But when I do.. it's a game that I spent time playing and I still want more. Has no ads and is enjoyable and challenging. Doesn't make you feel like you have to play it all the time but it comes on your mind when you have some downtime - I could solve a puzzle or two! Definitely recommended. I'd say one of the few must have games for your android that you'll keep for a looong time because it just never gets old
