But after using it for 3 days I noticed my phone slowed down drastically.

Getting a surprise wallpaper is so enjoyable. And the best part is that I can set personal family photos  but  due to the tasteful blur  no one else can really see them unless they know to double tap. So  I get to look at changing personal family photos every time I use my phone  but I don't have to worry about strangers or coworkers seeing family every time I use my phone in public. 5 stars. Best app on my phone.

Thanks Roman. Would it not be easier for the default to be focussed and peeps can then blur it if they want? Don't quite know why they would want to  but appreciate different strokes for different folks. Thanks again. P.s. could you make it storable on SD card rather than internal memory  as when peeps internal phones become full they may have to lose this App.

The design of the app is great  I know you are going to focus on memory optimization  but you need to add and change some things. There needs to be an option to disable downloads of wallpapers over mobile data. You also need to make the blur and dim sliders more responsive. You also need an NSFW checkbox  just in case there are those kind of paintings. Hope you consider the feedback.
