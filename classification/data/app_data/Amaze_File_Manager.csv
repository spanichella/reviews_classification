It still has some good features that you typically only see in paid apps so that's definitely cool to see. The material design interface is also aesthetically pleasing and easy to navigate.

It can be more interactive during file transfer  copying  moving (please have a look at ASUS file manager). In Android 5.1 lollipop sometimes moving multiple files makes them disappear. Please ensure stability especially while moving  copying files. Please provide sidebar with quick navigation  means you can slide the bar very fast and release it to the alphabet you want  like you do in contacts app.

I one issue I have and that is I am trying to figure out how to give write access to the external 128GB MicroSD card. When I try to copy/paste  or cut/paste objects from one location to the other I am being told I need to choose the root folder of the resource (external MicroSD card) and give it write permissions. But  no where is it clear as to how to do this. At least it is not obvious how to do so. One feature I would like to see is  the ability to copy/cut/paste files from my home network's computer  NAS  etc.  over WiFi to my Android device as well. Other then that  wonderful and simple file manager. A big thank you.

Also  add more features for a power user  like SD card and cloud storage. And make navigation a bit easier  like when I'm trying to go back to the main screen by cycling through the folders I had to go straight back to the menu instead of tracking back in the folders.

I just wish 'cut + paste' actually did cut and paste. To me  it just makes a new copy instead of moving. Other than that  perfect! Good looking  fast moving and customizable. _ÙÔ

Switched from ES because recently  it has become a spam and bloatware heavy app  and the top in battery draining list. Some bugs/suggestions: 1. Copy paste and cut paste notification stays on forever. Therefore next operation in queue won't start. 2. Have to set the default home tabs  each time I open the app. 3. Dual toolbar top (static) and bottom  would have been great. 4. The top ui bar should occupy less space  and be static with address  tabs  three line menu switch  etc. The dynamic style of it hinders easy copy pasting  directory switching etc 5. Grid view is not as comfortable as ES  cannot get the same experience even after adjusting the no of rows

So far  so good. Easy to find my items  accesses my sd card  I even was able to change the colors so it is easy on the eyes. I am still able to edit my documents on my phone. *maybe that is a different app that does that  no clue!* Anyway  I am a happy camper again. Looking forward to the usage of this app! Thanks  Amaze!
