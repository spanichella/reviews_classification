Doesn't lose track of what you're listening to regardless of phone calls  reboots  or long-term pauses.

It does exactly what it says on the label and it does it very well. It allows you to subscribe  download and organize your podcasts in a very intuitive way without any extraneous bells and whistles  and it just works. As other reviewers have said  it's a far better  more user-friendly app than many commercial podcatchers I've tried  so kudos to the AntennaPod team for keeping it free and open source!

I can understand why you would buy one. But how would I know I would keep listening to podcasts enough to justify me buying anything. I looked for several free options until I stumbled into antennapod. So far i love it  and really appreciate that it is open source. You guys have really done the world a service with your app.

The playback stalls and freezes and plays intermittently  and won't allow me to 'come out' of the episode. The only way to do this is to close the app itself and open it again. Having said that  I have tried a few podcast apps on my android phone and this has suited me better than those up until the recent issues  so I will probably continue to use it and hope that updates resolve the problem

Sometimes it'll actually play  but a lot of the time it simply crashes. Incredibly annoying. Also  after adding a podcast  you have to go through several steps to get to the newly added podcast to play it. This is on a Galaxy S5

Setup takes a bit longer in antenna pod than stitcher  but this app actually stores podcasts to sd card rather than holding then in the phones ram. Benefit: when you go on a 7 hour road trip you actually have something to listen to instead of only having the two podcast in your phones ram. This is simple with no ads. It just works!

It would be great if we had more options per podcast. E.g. to be able to set one podecast autoclean every 2 days  and another every 2 weeks. Other than that  it is an excellent app  stable  light  functional intuitive  well designed  and has active devs. I tried a bunch of other podcast apps and I found this one to be the best for me. Furthermore  if you had a donate option I'm sure a bunch of us would chip in something.

Starting from adding your first podcast  the GPodder integration means you will probably never have to search for an XML file again  since it will already be searchable in the gpodder directory. Other useful features include a sleep timer  excellent crash recovery (though crashes aren't that frequent)  and headphone awareness. I'd recommend giving it a try before throwing a few bucks to another Podcatcher.

If you are happy to play around and look online for info it is a good option. I will not be returning to podkicker
