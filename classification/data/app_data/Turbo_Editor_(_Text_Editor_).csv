Unfortunately, if I hold the shift key to get a capital letter this program won't type anything. So shift means do nothing. I have to remember to press caps lock and then caps again. It's a larger issue for those symbols though. You can't get symbols by caps lock so I am prevented from using my keyboard for symbols entirely, so I can't take quick notes in computer science lecture. That could use fixing, especially since some symbols like $ is not possible from the bottom menu."
