No updates  dubious behavior with Bluetooth keyboards and some unusual ui quirks.. Well  I can't say it's now quirk free  but I can say that in terms of core features provided  it's definitely catching up to JuiceSSH. One particularly nifty feature present in ConnectBot that's a pay feature in JuiceSSH is port forwarding.. Very helpful when wanting to quickly check things behind a firewall... Now if only Android browsers made it easier to set custom proxies...

It's a little finicky with puttygen private keys  but that's easily solved by generating the keys in the app.

Seems like a decent program  but suffers from the major design flaw of assuming that everyone's phone has a trackball. Do they even still make Android phones with trackballs? I can't remember seeing one in 5 years at least. But without such a button  there's no way to type CTRL or ALT characters  or activate function keys (or at least none I could find after about a half hour of playing with the app and googling). It seems like such a glaring oversight  and prevents this from being an awesome tool.

However  the resolution settings are so screwed up to where they're almost useless. I can't even insert an asterisk (*) into the terminal  so searching for files using wildcard can't happen. Additionally  there's tickets dated way back in 2011 and 2010 that have people questioning how to import private keys from their SD card and this is still an issue. Ridiculous. I felt pretty confident that this would work considering the amount of downloads; however  there's so much in here that seems broken or half-assed.

OK  it is hard to work with the small font and still seeing only a small fraction of the screen you are used to. But this is a principle problem and not a fault of the app. The same is true for the keyboard. But as you have access to CTRL and ESC  using screen and vim is possible.
