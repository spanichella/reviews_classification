Financius was the best expense manager that I had seen during the time I was using it. Once I encountered another app called Expense Manager, it became a tossup on which one was better. Financius offers a better UI and reporting, while Expense Manager offers decent reporting with meh UI, but most importantly I think, Expense Manager has widgets to quick-add expenses, while Financius does not. To put that in perspective, using Expense Manager, i have my 8 most used categories on a homescreen, tap one it brings up a expense entry screen, selecting the category. I enter an amount and hit submit. Financius requires me to start the app, hit new transaction, enter an amount, select category, select tags (if applicable) and then submit. So I prefer Financius for the reporting and UI, but Expense Manager for the functionality. If Financius were to add widgets, it would reign supreme for me again."

It's the best simplest financial app imo. Would like to see more improvement. I'll suggest more on the statistics such as search & filter feature. New feature such as budgets & notification once budget reached are also high upgrade to this app. Cool app btw
