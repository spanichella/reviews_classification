What makes this one better than the circle one is that YOU CAN ACTUALLY READ the number on the taskbar  as the circle battery app looks ridiculously tiny.

Though it rounds up to the next hour after 30 mins (so when your phone's been unplugged for 1 hr 35 mins  it appears as 2 hrs in the notification bar). It's misleading sometimes so I suggest you adjust the round up to maybe 45 mins onwards? Otherwise  it's a great app.

It tells the exact battery percent so i know when i need to charge it. The really big drawback is that it drains battery. I read online that battery monitor apps have to examine and get information from the battery frequently  thus draining it faster. I'll stay away from it now  for i do not know if there will be long term effects on the battery. It's a very nice and informative app though. :)

Then recently  I noticed my battery percentage was off by no less than 30%. The app showed my battery was draining nearly 10% every minute  doing nothing on it. But if it read 20%  i connect the charger and it reads something like 80%  take off charger  and sinks down to 5% in about a minute. I don't understand it anymore.

Example: 50% of my battery lasts for about 24 hours (it's a tablet lol). I think many users would appreciate this option too. Cheers :D

The application starts up with booting but does not delay the startup process of the phone by a single second  i have fall in love with the android OS after downloading this ultimate app.
