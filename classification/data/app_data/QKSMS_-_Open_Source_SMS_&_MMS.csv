Lots of features can be configured  such as turning off the avatars in the conversation window so you have more room for the actual messages. The code is open source which is very cool. There are no ads. It is free with a donate button in the app  I certainly sent the developer a donation.

So QKSMS is a treasure to me! Fantastic functionality (popup replies  text delay  customisability  proximity sensor  etc) AND design. Things like having the choice to hide contacts' phone numbers on the messaging screen are a really nice touch. Devs: would like to see a grey icon option and some slick animations in Conversations page  but that's honestly all I can think of. Will donate on payday!

I was looking for an app to replace my stock sms app. Messenger by Google was nice but too simple and lacked customization. There is a small glitch in menu I noticed when toggling options some other switches appear to move. Also some options appear to be 'on' but are greyed out.

The app is very solid. The only thing I really like more about Textra is the ability to personalize bubble colors for a specific contact. This is especially helpful during group texting. Just something to think about.

It's a simple yet beautiful app that's also pretty snappy. I'm giving it 4 stars though because notifications are kind of hit or miss. Sometimes they work perfect  sometimes the sound works but there's no notification  and sometimes nothing comes up at all. I think if this is fixed  it will definitely be the best sms app out there! EDIT: This is more of a suggestion  but the proximity sensor feature is way too sensitive.

However  there are two important functions that I still yet to get from this app. Firstly  Android phones commonly have dual sim cards and this app doesn't have the option for users to choose from which sim card they're sending the message from. Second  it doesn't have the option to directly save a contact from within the app. Also  a bug is literally annoying me. When I launch the app  it freezes  displays contact numbers instead of names and crashes.

Love this app. This has been the stock sms app replacement I've been looking for! I just have a small problem: whenever I compose a new message and send it  it doesn't seem to appear on the screen instantly. I have to exit the app first to see the text message I've sent. Hoping this could be fixed in an update.

Not smooth. It still lags (albeit less) and freezes with a white screen. The pop-up window lags too  not showing the body of the message for 2 seconds or so. It tends to pop up even when I'm within the app! Drafts are not visible! I have to open my stock app to see them. Deleted messages are not being deleted (I still see them in the stock app). Also  the new message indicator on the qksms icon shows I've got a new txt when I have none.

But so far from what I see it looks good. Love the customizations of backgrounds. Would like to see you add a privacy policy tho so I know exactly what's going on before I delete the app for Textra.. This app also seems to sync good with the Hub on my BlackBerry  behaves similar to stock google in that it launches the app to view message out side the hub...

Hopefully on you next update  it's something to do with group messaging. Like most messaging apps  when sending a message to multiple people  aside from it showing on each receiver's thread  every message should be found in one thread so I don't need to retype the names of my receivers in every message I wish to send by group. I tried several messaging apps available in Google play store and even the default messaging app of my Sony Xperia C3 failed me in sending group messages for they can't cater long messages that are mostly sent in group  it keeps prompting error messages before a message is successfully sent. And I'm hoping that this messaging app is not like that. With your next update  hopefully you'll have several options for font styles like the choco cooky font style of Samsung phones for that's actually my frustration in my phone (At least I can achieve it through this messaging app). I really love this app that's why I'm making an effort to help in its improvement. Kudos QKSMS team!

It's extremely fast  which I can't say about some other apps (ahem  mysms)  and its completely free with no annoying ads! It also handles the T-Mobile WiFi calling MMS conflict the best out of any app I've seen! The only problem I have with it is when you're in night mode and go to enter a recipient for a new text  the search results are in white text on a white background  so you can't see who you're choosing  womp.

Bugs I've noticed so far is that the app does not actually delete messages  I have another SMS app and I go in all the messages I thought I deleted with QK are still there. Theres NO notification of received MMS when data is disabled. When going back into the app when i have a new sms the sms doesnt show up  its blank. And is there any way to make the send icon a little smaller? I think it would fit in well with the overall look of the app. Also  an option to auto enable data when sending and receiving MMS?

However small bugs really detract from the overall experience. Sometimes SMS and MMS messages from one contact will temporarily appear in another conversation if you quickly switch conversations. Also  entire conversations sometimes temporarily disappear when opening the app through quick reply. It's these small clunky bugs that really hold this app back from being one of the best. Using LG G4

Many of my conversation are lost. at the end when I'm ready to close there is no send icon and when I tap to look for it your app just loses the whole conversation and my time is wasted. this happens way too often. I just had your app delete a whole message while I was trying to find your damneud send icon. there never is a send icon buddy! The second point is a good programmer never deletes anything obviously vital without asking for a confirmation! not asking is just PMS!

A recent update fixed the night mode issues I was having.

But there are a couple big issues for me: 1) Auto night mode is not consistent  and the text does not change to a contrasting color without backing out of or force restarting the app. 2) MMS works well  for receiving messages  but they are displayed as this ludicrously small slide show at the top of the screen. Why can't I look at each image individually and zoom?

Contact avatars are all kinds of buggy with photos of the wrong people getting placed with the wrong threads  group thread avatars are completely uninformative at a glance (Google Messenger does this MUCH better by showing up to 4 participants) and photo messages with text are not viewable - they play like a slideshow. Inability to add multiple photos at once to send and occasional lag are the nails in the coffin. Looks aren't everything - it has to work! Messenger it is  for me; Material Design & bug free.

But now it is sluggish and I often have to wait for it to open my conversation from a notification. Temporal and ancestral navigation is still not fixed since my last feedback. Also can't attach pictures from camera  but it worked before.

Not as much customization as others but that's fine...I do appreciate not being overwhelmed with endless options. I just wished one of the features I really use (delayed timer on messages sent) worked properly. From what I understand it has to be enabled before EVERY sent message...and even at that it still doesn't delay anything (even if I set the delay at 30 sec in the settings). It is a totally free/ad free app though...so I will stop complaining... Thks devs!!

Once or twice a day it has to be force stopped and restarted or the phone becomes sluggish. After restarting it the phone is fine for 12 to 20 hours.. installed on a Samsung S5. Fix that issue and I'd give it 5 plus stars.

Instead of the return key I have text smiley faces or frowns. Often text won't send & when it does I get either error code 1 or -1 & often when I send a photo it doesn't send at all. Very frustrating. I'm going to look for an SMS that actually works unless they decide to fix these bugs

First off  it needs to give the option to click on a contact name when starting a new message conversation. It is very annoying to have to manually enter a phone number that already exists in your contact list. Secondly  it needs to give the option to attach files not just access the gallery. I prefer personally to attach photos directly from my file manager and it will not allow for this. Other than that it is a very useful application. I love the dark and app and black themes period I am legally blind so having a dark theme is a must. It really helps being able to see it and the adjustable fonts are helpful as well.
