There is a desktop version and you can synchronize between mobile and desktop version. The only drawback is that the data can occupy significant amount of space and the app does not support storing data on external card. I use Samsung S5 which does not support adoption of external card space /Samsung states that this slows down the apps/ so I'm running frequently out of disk space.

This only requires about 20 mins every morning. The app works very well  I can confirm that. You need to create the cards using the (free open source) computer program  it is not possible to create the cards using the app. Card creation is the initial part of the learning process  and you end up with cards that you have created for your needs. This flexability is one of the great things about anki. Ability to sync cards is great too.

I did have an issue: I removed media from deleted decks in Anki desktop  then synced to Ankiweb  then to Ankidroid. For some reason Ankidroid would restore those unlinked media files  so I had to delete all my decks  do an empty cross-sync and start over. Not a big deal being a useful and free app  but I would recommend to anyone with the same issue just to save time if the sync keeps mumping up. Huge thanks to the Dev Team!

You can waste a lot of time watching tutorials  hoping that they will get around to mentioning the existence of Android or PC or showing the non-Apple/iPhone interfaces (spoiler: they don't). And you can waste a lot of time trying to find the missing features you saw in the tutorials  (spoiler: they are not there). Finally  you can search their manual and supporting documentation for some sort of acknowledgement that these features are missing form the Android/PC versions of the software  so you can allow yourself to stop searching in vain and go to bed  but this search will be fruitless too. So  if you want an intelligent program training you on flashcards using spaced repetition  and you don't mind that you can do only the most nominal of editing of the cards themselves  this one is for you. But don't expect greatness  or supporting materials for non Apple users.

The language I'm learning uses three fairly obscure characters: ®´ ®_ ®ö. These show up fine on the desktop version  but render as blank spaces or a ? on the app. These misrenders then get synced back onto the database. Is there a chance this could get fixed  or should I go ahead and find alternate characters to represent them? 2. One of the advantages of a mobile app flashcard system is that you can easily create audio flashcards in the field. The current app requires five touches to record audio (+  Add  paperclip  record audio  RECORD). It would be great to be able to do this in fewer steps  though I realize that might not be possible without overcrowding the interface.

There is simply no better way to retain information than through flashcard programs like these  and Anki is the program for power users. Although editing cards on mobile is difficult  it's 100% compatible with the full-featured desktop version of Anki  so all management can take place there. Couldn't be happier.

Other than that I can see the benefits of this system but why they didn't include this functionality for learning languages is beyond me.

I wish I could see all of my cards in a deck in a list so I could choose which to look at. I wish I could make decks on my computer and there were a way to synch them on my phone through an account. I wish the push notifications would send when cards are due  and not only when I actually open the app. What use is that? I wish the push notifications didn't resend any time my screen turns off in the middle of studying a deck. I wish there were some pre-made decks for students in popular subjects such as anatomy or psychology or languages. Maybe charge a dollar for access to pre made decks. It would really be worth it  because making flashcards for anatomy consumes way more time than I can afford  really  but I have to do it.

What's more  as well as downloading preset decks  you can create your own flash cards and organise them into decks. The only downside is the lack of preset decks in certain subjects  such as programming languages.

I made a ton of notecards once to help me study Persian and I never used them because they were so clunky to carry around. Anki makes it easy to put in time each day.

There is somewhat of a learning curve involved  but it is a truly rewarding app that I recommend to everyone. I feel thankful to use an Android instead of iOS as the iOS version costs US $25 and in my opinion isn't as good.

It is extremely flexible and offers countless ways to customize your deck. I personally prefer to create the cards on my desktop and sync with my portable devices. Include pictures and sound with your cards  enable the whiteboard to write your answers  require that the answer be typed in  create cloze cards etc. You can even create multiple cards with one click: forwards/backwards/spelling or use it to have one image with several labeled parts  each part with its own card. If you don't want all of this  you can also just keep your cards simple. I highly recommend watching a tutorial video or reading the manual so that you can make the most of this amazing app.

However  for the first-time user  it does look complicated until you understand the actual framework - i.e. how it was thought to work. A suggestion here - in the help system  change 'cards' for 'templates' where appropriate. Once i got my head around templates and different types  i got myself to design few common types i use most and bang! Adding actual flashcards now using the templates is as simple as it can be .... And i can use cloze-types  images  etc.

Today I am happy to report that AnkiDroid does exactly what I wanted. Adding cards is easy; the review interface is streamlined and practical to use with one thumb; and it does a good job of showing the cards I am struggling with. Synchronization between AnkiDroid (on a phone and a tablet)  the desktop app  and the web site all works smoothly. The navigation in the AnkiDroid UI confused me somewhat when I first starting using it. For example  the back button moves up to a higher level in the app structure  rather than returning you to the previous screen  which is fine but unexpected. Once I got used to the layout it works well.

If you get it right twice you have to wait a day to review the word again. So I tried saying I got all them wrong so I could review then whenever I wanted. After you get more than one wrong it will just constantly go back to the words you got wrong; preventing you from practicing other. It also goes in the order that they were added. So as I'm reviewing them more and more  because of memory I can see one word and know what the next word will be.

This is where the program breaks down there is no way to simply add a deck from anki pc to ankidroid without completely overwriting all progress and cards on ankidroid. This is disappointing to say the least.

Among its virtues: * Multi-platform (desktop/Web/phone) and connected. * Media-rich: study more than just text. * Sophisticated review system. * Share and collaborate on card sets. * Free as in freedom. * The development community is receptive to contributions of any kind  if you want to take part.

Also wish it had a button to create the cloze brackets instead of manually having to type them. The apple version does both of these things. I have to create cards on Apple and study them here because the android version is better at reviewing (shows estimated times  studied time is summed up). That's all this app needs to make it perfect. It's literally a small fix so I really hope the development team adds it.

Or at least all that was prompted for was to login to the site, and the decks showed zero. I had built a few decks. I feel that maybe for an Open Source project still alive, I judged to harshly after my initial shock. I'm still going to have to dig through old storage backups for any possible files. I already deleted the application on the phone. 5/3/2016 I was able to remove the /storage/sdcard0/AnkiDroid/ folder. Install the Application again.

For example, it totally tries to own when and what I can study. It disappears my cards if it thinks I have studied them enough, forcing me to go and figure out how to put them back into the study session based on how many days to advance my ""review"" session. If I want to set up a custom study session to force it to allow me to study what I want, when I want, again it disappears the original deck - where I can no longer ""browse"" my list of cards, which btw, I have to do whenever I want to see a custom field because the app does not make it easy to add the field to the study deck.

I wish I could see all of my cards in a deck in a list so I could choose which to look at. I wish I could make decks on my computer and there were a way to synch them on my phone through an account. I wish the push notifications would send when cards are due, and not only when I actually open the app. What use is that? I wish the push notifications didn't resend any time my screen turns off in the middle of studying a deck. I wish there were some pre-made decks for students in popular subjects such as anatomy or psychology or languages. Maybe charge a dollar for access to pre made decks. It would really be worth it, because making flashcards for anatomy consumes way more time than I can afford, really, but I have to do it."

EDIT: thanks for pointing me to the doc but I know how to edit deck properties, it just crashes. After a few more tests I realized note editing is also very buggy. If I want to edit a note, after pressing the tick button it says that the app crashed, it restarts and my edition was lost. EDIT2: checking database did not work. The edit note crashes when editing it WHILE IN REVIEW MODE, don't know if it helps."
