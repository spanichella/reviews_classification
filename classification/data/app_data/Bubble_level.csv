I can calibrate it for one side but then it is quite wrong on the other side. It would be good to be able to tell it which side I'm using and have a separate calibration for that side. Likewise, the back of the phone has a camera lens sticking out that throws it completely out but that could be calibrated out too."

That the app and I did a perfect job!!! And he even compared it to his real leveller from Home Depot and it worked perfect they both match up 100%!!! I recommend this app to everybody!"

(I used 1"""""""" Styrofoam insulation) Float the foam in a bowl or your sink full of water. Place your phone on top of the foam and wait until it stops moving.......press calibrate. It should be fairly accurate at that point. I have a Samsung S2x with a battery that bulges out at the back and it was the only way I could figure out how to get level with it. Simple but useful app. Thanks. Edit- Decided to buy the """"""""Pro Version"""""""" Worth the $2 (Canadian :-) )"
