(Still works as desktop widget.) AFAIK  it would require xposed framework and root to work. This is not dev's fault  but should be made clear. (If it can be made to work  he deserves more than five stars.) If you don't like it  complain to Google - my view is that apart from technical improvements  it's downhill after jb.

Only used it for a couple of hours  so don't know if there are other issues  but the biggest improvement for me would be supporting double-tap  when the widget is expanded to the full home screen. Double tap turns the screen on/off on LG G3  and it's one of my favorite Android features. To make it work  I need to leave some free area on the screen  but this means  I cannot display everything I want in the wizard. Would be lot more user-friendly  if the widget just passed the double-tap signal to the OS.

Instead of only adjusting the transparency  I wish there was a setting were it would create a small shadow behind each character. This would create enough contrast for the text to stand out.

Unfortunately on the S4/Note etc  Samsung ?stupidly? decided that you can't have a secured lock screen while having your own personal widgets like this. So you either have an unsecured lock which allows for widgets  easy camera access  or a secured lock which only allows for their boring clock and stupid/useless personal message crap? Why? Google has already designed lock screen widgets to work perfectly with a secure lock Samsung. This is why people like your phones but not your software.

All the 3rd party extensions make it very flexible. Also  it made some small apps redundent so I got to delete them. It would be nice if android allowed you to set lock screen widgets to use the full screen though. Not the apps fault but would improve things.

I think it best for font size when widget is expanded to be remain the same as when widget is collapsed - that way the benefit of expanding the area is - no pun intended - maximized.

Only used it for a couple of hours, so don't know if there are other issues, but the biggest improvement for me would be supporting double-tap, when the widget is expanded to the full home screen. Double tap turns the screen on/off on LG G3, and it's one of my favorite Android features. To make it work, I need to leave some free area on the screen, but this means, I cannot display everything I want in the wizard. Would be lot more user-friendly, if the widget just passed the double-tap signal to the OS."
