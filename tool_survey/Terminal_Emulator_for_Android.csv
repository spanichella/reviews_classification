Allows rooted android custom ROMs to change your native resolutions from 4k to 1080p which will help battery life and avoid screen burns. You can also change pixel density as well aka PPI. Tips- first type: su then press enter. Then to change resolution from quad HD to 1080p type: wm size 1080x1920. To change pixel density type: wm density (PPI amount) ex. 420 for moto x pure or nexus 6 493 or note 5 518 etc. To reset resolution back to quad HD type: wm size reset. To reset PPI type: wm density reset.
